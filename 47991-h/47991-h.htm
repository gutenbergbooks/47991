    <h2>
      I INTRODUCTORY TO AN ODD CHARACTER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>n Sundays he is
      the beadle of our church; at other times he Waits. In his ecclesiastical
      character there is a solemn dignity about his deportment that compels most
      of us to call him Mr MacPherson; in his secular hours, when passing the
      fruit at a city banquet, or when at the close of the repast he sweeps away
      the fragments of the dinner-rolls, and whisperingly expresses in your left
      ear a fervent hope that &ldquo;ye&rsquo;ve enjoyed your dinner,&rdquo; he is simply Erchie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once I forgot, deluded a moment into a Sunday train of thought by his
      reverent way of laying down a bottle of Pommery, and called him Mr
      MacPherson. He reproved me with a glance of his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nae Mr MacPhersons here,&rdquo; said he afterwards; &ldquo;at whit ye might
      call the social board I&rsquo;m jist Erchie, or whiles Easy-gaun Erchie wi&rsquo; them
      that kens me langest. There&rsquo;s sae mony folks in this world don&rsquo;t like to
      hurt your feelings that if I was kent as Mr MacPherson on this kind o&rsquo; job
      I wadna mak&rsquo; enough to pay for starchin&rsquo; my shirts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I suppose Mr MacPherson has been snibbing-in preachers in St Kentigern&rsquo;s
      Kirk pulpit and then going for twenty minutes&rsquo; sleep in the vestry since
      the Disruption; and the more privileged citizens of Glasgow during two or
      three generations of public dinners have experienced the kindly
      ministrations of Erchie, whose proud motto is &ldquo;A flet fit but a warm
      hert.&rdquo; I think, however, I was the first to discover his long pent-up and
      precious strain of philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Saturday nights, in his office as beadle of St Kentigern&rsquo;s, he lights
      the furnaces that take the chill off the Sunday devotions. I found him
      stoking the kirk fires one Saturday, not very much like a beadle in
      appearance, and much less like a waiter. It was what, in England, they
      call the festive season.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s mair nor guid preachin&rsquo; wanted to keep a kirk gaun,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;if
      I was puttin&rsquo; as muckle dross on my fires as the Doctor whiles puts in his
      sermons, efter a Setturday at the gowf, ye wad see a bonny difference on
      the plate. But it&rsquo;s nae odds-a beadle gets sma&rsquo; credit, though it&rsquo;s him
      that keeps the kirk tosh and warm, and jist at that nice easy-osy
      temperature whaur even a gey cauldrife member o&rsquo; the congregation can tak&rsquo; 
      his nap and no&rsquo; let his lozenge slip doon his throat for chitterin wi&rsquo; the
      cauld.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a remarkably small congregation at St Kentigern&rsquo;s on the
      following day, and when the worthy beadle had locked the door after
      dismissal and joined me on the pavement, &ldquo;Man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it was a puir
      turn-oot yon&mdash;hardly worth puttin&rsquo; on fires for. It&rsquo;s aye the wye;
      when I mak&rsquo; the kirk a wee bit fancy, and jalouse there&rsquo;s shair to be twa
      pound ten in the plate, on comes a blash o&rsquo; rain, and there&rsquo;s hardly whit
      wid pay for the starchin&rsquo; o&rsquo; the Doctor&rsquo;s bands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christmas! They ca&rsquo;t Christmas, but I could gie anither name for&rsquo;t. I
      looked it up in the penny almanac, and it said, &lsquo;Keen frost; probably
      snow,&rsquo; and I declare-to if I hadna nearly to soom frae the hoose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The almanacs is no&rsquo; whit they used to be; the auld chaps that used to
      mak&rsquo; them maun be deid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They used to could do&rsquo;t wi&rsquo; the least wee bit touch, and tell ye in
      January whit kind o&rsquo; day it wad be at Halloween, besides lettin&rsquo; ye ken
      the places whaur the Fair days and the &lsquo;ool-markets was, and when they
      were to tak&rsquo; place-a&rsquo; kind o&rsquo; information that maist o&rsquo; us that bocht the
      almanacs couldna sleep at nicht wantin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;ve seen me get up at three on a
      cauld winter&rsquo;s mornin&rsquo; and strikin&rsquo; a licht to turn up Orr&rsquo;s Penny
      Commercial and see whit day was the Fair at Dunse. I never was at Dunse in
      a&rsquo; my days, and hae nae intention o&rsquo; gaun, but it&rsquo;s a grand thing
      knowledge, and it&rsquo;s no&rsquo; ill to cairry. It&rsquo;s like poetry-&rsquo;The Star o&rsquo; 
      Rabbie Burns&rsquo; and that kind o&rsquo; thing-ye can aye be givin&rsquo; it a ca&rsquo; roond
      in your mind when ye hae naething better to dae.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, ay! A puir turn-oot the day for Kenti-gern&rsquo;s; that&rsquo;s the drawback o&rsquo; 
      a genteel congregation like oors-mair nor half o&rsquo; them&rsquo;s sufferin&rsquo; frae
      Christmas turkey and puttin&rsquo; the blame on the weather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bubbly-jock is the symbol o&rsquo; Scotland&rsquo;s decline and fa&rsquo;; we maybe
      bate the English at Bannockburn, but noo they&rsquo;re haein&rsquo; their revenge and
      underminin&rsquo; oor constitution wi&rsquo; the aid o&rsquo; a bird that has neither a braw
      plumage nor a bonny sang, and costs mair nor the price o&rsquo; three or four
      ducks. England gave us her bubbly-jock and took oor barley-bree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a&rsquo; richt; Ne&rsquo;erday&rsquo;s comin&rsquo;; it&rsquo;s begun this year gey early, for
      I saw Duffy gaun up his close last nicht wi&rsquo; his nose peeled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Am I gaun hame, or am I comin&rsquo; frae&rsquo;t, can ye tell me?&rsquo; says he, and he
      was carryin&rsquo; something roond-shaped in his pocket-naipkin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Whit&rsquo;s wrang wi&rsquo; ye, puir cratur?&rsquo; I says to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I was struck wi&rsquo; a sheet o&rsquo; lichtnin&rsquo;,&rsquo; says he, and by that I ken&rsquo;t he
      had been doon drinkin&rsquo; at the Mull o&rsquo; Kintyre Vaults, and that the season
      o&rsquo; peace on earth, guid-will to men was fairly started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;MacPherson,&rsquo; he says, wi&rsquo; the tear at his e&rsquo;e, &lsquo;I canna help it, but I&rsquo;m
      a guid man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ye are that, Duffy,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;when ye&rsquo;re in your bed sleepin&rsquo;; at ither
      times ye&rsquo;re like the rest o&rsquo; us, and that&rsquo;s gey middlin&rsquo;. Whit hae&rsquo;ye in
      the naipkin?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He gied a dazed look at it, and says, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m no shair, but I think it&rsquo;s a
      curlin&rsquo;-stane, and me maybe gaun to a bonspiel at Carsbreck.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He opened it oot, and found it was a wee, roond, red cheese.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s me, a&rsquo; ower,&rsquo; says he&mdash;&lsquo;a Christmas for the wife,&rsquo; and I
      declare there was as much drink jaupin&rsquo; in him as wad hae done for a
      water-&rsquo;shute.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scotland&rsquo;s last stand in the way o&rsquo; national customs is bein&rsquo; made at the
      Mull o&rsquo; Kintyre Vaults, whaur the flet half-mutchkin, wrapped up in
      magenta tissue paper so that it&rsquo;ll look tidy, is retreatin&rsquo; doggedly, and
      fechtin&rsquo; every fit o&rsquo; the way, before the invadin&rsquo; English Christmas
      caird. Ten years ago the like o&rsquo; you and me couldna&rsquo; prove to a freen&rsquo; 
      that we liked him fine unless we took him at this time o&rsquo; the year into
      five or six public-hooses, leaned him up against the coonter, and grat on
      his dickie. Whit dae we dae noo? We send wee Jennie oot for a shilling box
      o&rsquo; the year afore last&rsquo;s patterns in Christmas cairds, and show oor
      continued affection and esteem at the ha&rsquo;penny postage rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Instead o&rsquo;, takin&rsquo; Duffy roon&rsquo; the toon on Ne&rsquo;erday, and hurtin&rsquo; my heid
      wi&rsquo; tryin&rsquo; to be jolly, I send him a Christmas caird, wi&rsquo; the picture o&rsquo; a
      hayfield on the ootside and &lsquo;Wishin&rsquo; you the Old, Old Wish, Dear,&rsquo; on the
      inside, and stay in the hoose till the thing blaws bye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The shilling box o&rsquo; Christmas cairds is the great peace-maker; a gross or
      twa should hae been sent oot to Russia and Japan, and it wad hae stopped
      the war.&rsquo; Ye may hae thocht for a twelvemonth the MacTurks were a disgrace
      to the tenement, wi&rsquo; their lassie learnin&rsquo; the mandolin&rsquo;, and them haein&rsquo; 
      their gas cut aff at the meter for no&rsquo; payin&rsquo; the last quarter; but let
      them send a comic caird to your lassie&mdash;&lsquo;Wee Wullie to Wee Jennie,&rsquo; 
      and they wad get the len&rsquo; o&rsquo; your wife&rsquo;s best jeely-pan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&rsquo; but whit there&rsquo;s trouble wi&rsquo; the Christmas caird. It&rsquo;s only when ye
      buy a shillin&rsquo; box and sit doon wi&rsquo; the wife and weans to consider wha
      ye&rsquo;ll send them to that ye fin&rsquo; oot whit an awfu&rsquo; lot o&rsquo; freen&rsquo;s ye hae. A
      score o&rsquo; shillin&rsquo; boxes wadna gae ower half the kizzens I hae, wi&rsquo; my
      grandfaither belangin&rsquo; to the Hielan&rsquo;s, so Jinnet an&rsquo; me jist let&rsquo;s on to
      some o&rsquo; them we&rsquo;re no&rsquo; sendin&rsquo; ony cairds oot this year because it&rsquo;s no&rsquo; 
      the kin&rsquo; o&rsquo; society go ony langer. And ye have aye to keep pairt o&rsquo; the
      box till Ne&rsquo;erday to send to some o&rsquo; the mair parteeclar anes ye forgot a&rsquo; 
      thegither were freen&rsquo;s o&rsquo; yours till they sent ye a caird.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anither fau&rsquo;t I hae to the Christmas cairds is that the writin&rsquo; on them&rsquo;s
      generally fair rideeculous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;May Christmas Day be Blythe and Gay, and bring your household Peace and
      Joy,&rsquo; is on the only caird left ower to send to Mrs Maclure; and when
      ye&rsquo;re shearin&rsquo; aff the selvedges o&rsquo;t to mak&rsquo; it fit a wee envelope, ye
      canna but think that it&rsquo;s a droll message for a hoose wi&rsquo; five weans lyin&rsquo; 
      ill wi&rsquo; the whoopin&rsquo;-cough, and the man cairryin&rsquo; on the wye Maclure does.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Old friends, old favourites, Joy be with you at this Season,&rsquo; says the
      caird for the MacTurks, and ye canna but mind that every third week
      there&rsquo;s a row wi&rsquo; Mrs MacTurk and your wife aboot the key o&rsquo; the
      washin&rsquo;-hoose and lettin&rsquo; the boiler rust that bad a&rsquo; the salts o&rsquo; sorrel
      in the Apothecaries&rsquo;ll no tak&rsquo; the stains aff your shirts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whit&rsquo;s wanted is a kin&rsquo; o&rsquo; slidin&rsquo; scale o&rsquo; sentiment on Christmas
      cairds, so that they&rsquo;ll taper doon frae a herty greetin&rsquo; ye can truthfully
      send to a dacent auld freen&rsquo; and the kind o&rsquo; cool &lsquo;here&rsquo;s to ye!&rsquo; suited
      for an acquaintance that borrowed five shillin&rsquo;s frae ye at the Term, and
      hasna much chance o&rsquo; ever payin&rsquo;t back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it wasna for the Christmas cairds a lot o&rsquo; us wad maybe never jalouse
      there was onything parteecular merry aboot the season. Every man that
      ye&rsquo;re owin&rsquo; an accoont to sends it to ye then, thinkin&rsquo; your hert&rsquo;s warm
      and your pouches rattlin&rsquo;. On Christmas Day itsel&rsquo; ye&rsquo;re aye expectin&rsquo; 
      something; ye canna richt tell whit it is, but there&rsquo;s ae thing certain&mdash;that
      it never comes. Jinnet, my wife, made a breenge for the door every time
      the post knocked on Thursday, and a&rsquo; she had for&rsquo;t at the end o&rsquo; the day
      was an ashet fu&rsquo; o&rsquo; whit she ca&rsquo;s valenteens, a&rsquo; written on so that
      they&rsquo;ll no even dae for next year.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I used to wonder whit the banks shut for at Christmas, but I ken noo;
      they&rsquo;re feart that their customers, cairried awa&rsquo; wi&rsquo; their feelin&rsquo; o&rsquo; 
      guid-will to men, wad be makin&rsquo; a rush on them to draw money for presents,
      and maybe create a panic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sae far as I can judge there&rsquo;s been nae panic at the banks this year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every Ne&rsquo;erday for the past fifty years I hae made up my mind I was gaun
      to be a guid man,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;It jist wants a start, they tell me that&rsquo;s
      tried it, and I&rsquo;m no&rsquo; that auld. Naething bates a trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gaun to begin at twelve o&rsquo;clock on Hogmanay, and mak&rsquo; a wee note o&rsquo;t
      in my penny diary, and put a knot in my hankie to keep me in mind. Maist
      o&rsquo; us would be as guid&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s ony need for if we had naething else to
      think o&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s like a man that&rsquo;s hen-taed&mdash;he could walk fine if he
      hadna a train to catch, or the rent to rin wi&rsquo; at the last meenute, or
      somethin&rsquo; else to bother him. I&rsquo;m gey faur wrang if I dinna dae the trick
      this year, though.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! ay. I&rsquo;m gaun to be a guid man. No&rsquo; that awfu&rsquo; guid that auld
      freen&rsquo;s&rsquo;ll rin up a close to hide when they see me comin&rsquo;, but jist dacent&mdash;jist
      guid enough to please mysel&rsquo;, like Duffy&rsquo;s singin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m no&rsquo; makin&rsquo; a
      breenge at the thing and sprainin&rsquo; my leg ower&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m startin&rsquo; canny till
      I get into the wye o&rsquo;t. Efter this Erchie MacPherson&rsquo;s gaun to flype his
      ain socks and no&rsquo; leave his claes reel-rail aboot the hoose at night for
      his wife Jinnet to lay oot richt in the mornin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;ve lost money by that
      up till noo, for there was aye bound to be an odd sixpence droppin&rsquo; oot
      and me no&rsquo; lookin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m gaun to stop skliffin&rsquo; wi&rsquo; my feet; it&rsquo;s sair on
      the boots. I&rsquo;m gaun to save preens by puttin&rsquo; my collar stud in a bowl and
      a flet-iron on the top o&rsquo;t to keep Erchie&rsquo;s Flitting it frae jinkin&rsquo; under
      the chevalier and book-case when I&rsquo;m sleepin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m gaun to wear oot a&rsquo; my
      auld waistcoats in the hoose. I&rsquo;m&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Erchie,&rdquo; I interrupted, &ldquo;these seem very harmless reforms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll dae to be gaun on wi&rsquo; the noo, for I&rsquo;m nae
      phenomena; I&rsquo;m jist Nature; jist the Rale Oreeginal.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      II ERCHIE&rsquo;S FLITTING
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>e came down the
      street in the gloaming on Tuesday night with a bird-cage in one hand and a
      potato-masher in the other, and I knew at once, by these symptoms, that
      Erchie was flitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the long trail, the old trail, the trail that is always new, Erchie?&rdquo;
       said I, as he tried to push the handle of the masher as far up his coat
      sleeve as possible, and so divert attention from a utensil so ridiculously
      domestic and undignified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re no&rsquo; that bad!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Six times in the four-and-forty year.
      We&rsquo;ve been thirty years in the hoose we&rsquo;re leavin&rsquo; the morn, and I&rsquo;m fair
      oot o&rsquo; the wye o&rsquo; flittin&rsquo;. I micht as weel start the dancin&rsquo; again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirty years! Your household gods plant a very firm foot, Erchie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man, ay! If it wisna for Jinnet and her new fandangles, I wad nae mair
      think o&rsquo; flittin&rsquo; than o&rsquo; buyin&rsquo; a balloon to mysel&rsquo;; but ye ken women!
      They&rsquo;re aye gaun to be better aff onywhaur else than whaur they are. I ken
      different, but I havena time to mak&rsquo; it plain to Jinnet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the following day I met Erchie taking the air in the neighbourhood of
      his new domicile, and smoking a very magnificent meerschaum pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was presented wi&rsquo; this pipe twenty years ago,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;by a man that
      went to California, and I lost it a week or twa efter that. It turned up
      at the flittin&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s ane o&rsquo; the advantages o&rsquo; flittin&rsquo;s; ye find things
      ye havena seen for years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope the great trek came off all right, Erchie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, ay! no&rsquo; that bad, considerin&rsquo; we were sae much oot o&rsquo; practice. It&rsquo;s
      no&rsquo; sae serious when ye&rsquo;re only gaun roond the corner to the next street.
      I cairried a lot o&rsquo; the mair particular wee things roond mysel&rsquo; last nicht&mdash;the
      birdcage and Gledstane&rsquo;s picture and the room vawzes and that sort o&rsquo; 
      thing, but at the hinder-end Jinnet made me tak&rsquo; the maist o&rsquo; them back
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back again, Erchie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay. She made oot that I had cairried ower sae muckle that the flittin&rsquo; 
      wad hae nae appearance on Duffy&rsquo;s cairt, and haein&rsquo; her mind set on the
      twa rakes, and a&rsquo; the fancy things lying at the close-mooth o&rsquo; the new
      hoose till the plain stuff was taken in, I had just to cairry back a guid
      part o&rsquo; whit I took ower last nicht. It&rsquo;s a rale divert the pride o&rsquo; 
      women! But I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; she&rsquo;s vex&rsquo;t for&rsquo;t the day, because yin o&rsquo; the
      things I took back was a mirror, and it was broke in Duffy&rsquo;s cairt. It&rsquo;s a
      gey unlucky thing to break a lookin&rsquo;-gless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A mere superstition, Erchie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dod! I&rsquo;m no&rsquo; sae shair o&rsquo; that. I kent a lookin&rsquo;-gless broke at a
      flittin&rsquo; afore this, and the man took to drink a year efter&rsquo;t, and has
      been that wye since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How came you to remove at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wad never hae happened if I hadna gane to a sale and seen a
      coal-scuttle. It&rsquo;s a dangerous thing to introduce a new coal-scuttle into
      the bosom o&rsquo; your faimily. This was ane o&rsquo; thae coal-scuttles wi&rsquo; a
      pentin&rsquo; o&rsquo; the Falls o&rsquo; Clyde and Tillitudlem Castle on the lid. I got it
      for three-and-tuppence; but it cost me a guid dale mair nor I bargained
      for. The wife was rale ta&rsquo;en wi&rsquo;t, but efter a week or twa she made oot
      that it gar&rsquo;d the auld room grate we had look shabby, and afore ye could
      say knife she had in a new grate wi&rsquo; wally sides till&rsquo;t, and an ash-pan I
      couldna get spittin&rsquo; on. Then the mantelpiece wanted a bed pawn on&rsquo;t to
      gie the grate a dacent look, and she pit on a plush yin. Ye wadna hinder
      her efter that to get plush-covered chairs instead o&rsquo; the auld hair-cloth
      we got when we were mairried. Her mither&rsquo;s chist-o&rsquo;-drawers didna gae very
      weel wi&rsquo; the plush chairs, she found oot in a while efter that, and they
      were swapped wi&rsquo; twa pound for a chevalier and book-case, though the only
      books I hae in the hoose is the Family Bible, Buchan&rsquo;s Domestic Medicine,&rsquo; 
      and the &lsquo;Tales o&rsquo; the Borders.&rsquo; It wad hae been a&rsquo; richt if things had
      gane nae further, but when she went to a sale hersel&rsquo; and bought a
      Brussels carpet a yaird ower larig for the room, she made oot there was
      naethin&rsquo; for&rsquo;t but to flit to a hoose wi&rsquo; a bigger room. And a&rsquo; that
      happened because a pented coal-scuttle took ma e&rsquo;e.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an old story, Erchie; &lsquo;c&rsquo;est le premier pas que coute,&rsquo; as the
      French say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The French is the boys!&rdquo; says Erchie, who never gives himself away.
      &ldquo;Weel, we&rsquo;re flittin&rsquo; onywye, and a bonny trauchle it is. I&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; be able
      to find my razor for a week or twa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a costly process, and three flittin&rsquo;s are worse than a fire, they
      say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s worse nor that; it&rsquo;s worse nor twa Irish lodgers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;ll cost jist next to naethin&rsquo;,&rsquo; says Jinnet. &lsquo;Duffy&rsquo;ll tak&rsquo; ower the
      furniture in his lorry for freen&rsquo;ship&rsquo;s sake, an&rsquo; there&rsquo;s naethin&rsquo; &lsquo;ll need
      to be done to the new hoose.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if ye ever flitted yersel&rsquo;, ye&rsquo;ll ken the funny wyes o&rsquo; the waxcloth
      that&rsquo;s never cut the same wye in twa hooses; and I&rsquo;ll need to be gey
      thrang at my tred for the next month of twa to pay for the odds and ends
      that Jinnet never thought o&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Duffy flitted us for naethin&rsquo;, but ye couldna but gie the men a dram. A
      flittin&rsquo; dram&rsquo;s by-ordinar; ye daurna be scrimp wi&rsquo;t, or they&rsquo;ll break
      your delf for spite, and ye canna be ower free wi&rsquo;t either, or they&rsquo;ll
      break everything else oot o&rsquo; fair guid-natur. I tried to dae the thing
      judeecious, but I forgot to hide the bottle, and Duffy&rsquo;s heid man and his
      mate found it when I wasna there, and that&rsquo;s wye the lookin&rsquo; gless was
      broken. Thae cairters divna ken their ain strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a humblin&rsquo; sicht your ain flittin&rsquo; when ye see&rsquo;t on the tap o&rsquo; a
      coal-lorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, Erchie; chiffoniers are like a good many reputations&mdash;they
      look all right so long as you don&rsquo;t get seeing the back of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And cairters hae nane o&rsquo; the finer feelin&rsquo;s, I think. In spite o&rsquo; a&rsquo; that
      Jinnet could dae, they left the pots and pans a&rsquo; efternoon on the
      pavement, and hurried the plush chairs up the stair at the first gae-aff.
      A thing like that&rsquo;s disheartenin&rsquo; to ony weel-daein&rsquo; woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Hoots!&rsquo; says I to her, &lsquo;whit&rsquo;s the odds? There&rsquo;s naebody heedin&rsquo; you nor
      your flittin&rsquo;.&rsquo; &ldquo;&lsquo;Are they no&rsquo;?&rsquo; said Jinnet, keekin&rsquo; up at the front o&rsquo; 
      the new land. &lsquo;A&rsquo; the Venetian blinds is doon, and I&rsquo;ll guarantee there&rsquo;s
      een behind them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We werena half-an-oor in the new hoose when the woman on the same
      stairheid chappet at the door and tellt us it was oor week o&rsquo; washin&rsquo; oot
      the close. It wasna weel meant, but it did Jinnet a lot o&rsquo; guid, for she
      was sitting in her braw new hoose greetin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Greetin&rsquo;, Erchie? Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask that! Ye&rsquo;ll maybe ken better nor I dae.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you have earned your evening pipe at least, Erchie,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knocked out its ashes on his palm with a sigh. &ldquo;I hiv that! Man, it&rsquo;s a
      gey dauntenin&rsquo; thing a flittin&rsquo;, efter a&rsquo;. I&rsquo;ve a flet fit, but a warm
      hert; and efter thirty years o&rsquo; the auld hoose I was swear&rsquo;t to leave&rsquo;t. I
      brocht up a family in&rsquo;t, and I wish Jinnet&rsquo;s carpet had been a fit or twa
      shorter, or that I had never seen yon coal-scuttle wi&rsquo; the Falls o&rsquo; Clyde
      and Tillitudlem Castle.&rdquo;

      III DEGENERATE DAYS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he tred&rsquo;s done,&rdquo;
       said Erchie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! beadling?&rdquo; I asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! there&rsquo;s naethin&rsquo; wrang wi&rsquo; beadlin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nae ups and
      doons there except to put the books on the pulpit desk, and they canna put
      ye aff the job if ye&rsquo;re no jist a fair wreck. I&rsquo;m a&rsquo; richt for the
      beadlin&rsquo; as lang&rsquo;s I keep my health and hae Jinnet to button my collar,
      and it&rsquo;s generally allo&rsquo;ed&mdash;though maybe I shouldna say&rsquo;t mysel&rsquo;&mdash;that
      I&rsquo;m the kind o&rsquo; don at it roond aboot Gleska. I michtna be, if I wasna gey
      carefu&rsquo;. Efter waitin&rsquo; at a Setterday nicht spree, I aye tak&rsquo; care to gie
      the bell an extra fancy ca&rsquo; or twa on the Sunday mornin&rsquo; jist to save
      clash and mak&rsquo; them ken Mac-Pherson&rsquo;s there himsel&rsquo;, and no&rsquo; some puir
      pick-up that never ca&rsquo;d the handle o&rsquo; a kirk bell in his life afore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no&rsquo; a man gangs to oor kirk wi&rsquo; better brushed boots than mysel&rsquo;,
      as Jinnet&rsquo;ll tell ye, and if I hae ae gift mair nor anither it&rsquo;s
      discretioncy. A beadle that&rsquo;s a waiter has to gae through life like the
      puir troot they caught in the Clyde the other day&mdash;wi&rsquo; his mooth
      shut, and he&rsquo;s worse aff because he hasna ony gills&mdash;at least no&rsquo; the
      kind ye pronounce that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beadlin&rsquo;s an art, jist like pentin&rsquo; photograph pictures, or playin&rsquo; the
      drum, and if it&rsquo;s no&rsquo; in ye, naethin&rsquo; &lsquo;ll put it there. I whiles see wee
      skina-malink craturs dottin&rsquo; up the passages in U.F. kirks carryin&rsquo; the
      books as if they were M.C.&lsquo;s at a dancin&rsquo;-schule ball gaun to tack up the
      programme in front o&rsquo; the band; they lack thon rale releegious glide; they
      havena the feet for&rsquo;t.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waitin&rsquo; is whit I mean; it&rsquo;s fair done!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I began the tred forty-five year syne in the auld Saracen Heid Inn,
      a waiter was looked up to, and was well kent by the best folk in the toon,
      wha&rsquo; aye ca&rsquo;d him by his first name when they wanted the pletform box o&rsquo; 
      cigaurs handed doon instead o&rsquo; the Non Plus Ultras.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nooadays they stick a wally door-knob wi&rsquo; a number on&rsquo;t in the lapelle o&rsquo; 
      his coat, and it&rsquo;s Hey, No. 9, you wi&rsquo; the flet feet, dae ye ca&rsquo; this
      ham?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if ye hadna been dacently christened and brocht up an honest faimily!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the auld days they didna drag a halflin callan&rsquo; in frae Stra&rsquo;ven, cut
      his nails wi&rsquo; a hatchet, wash his face, put a dickie and a hired suit on
      him, and gie him the heave into a banquet-room, whaur he disna ken the
      difference between a finger-bowl and a box o&rsquo; fuzuvian lichts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was speakin&rsquo; aboot that the ither nicht to Duffy, the coalman, and he
      says, &lsquo;Whit&rsquo;s the odds, MacPherson? Wha&rsquo; the bleezes couldna&rsquo; sling roon&rsquo; 
      blue-mange at the richt time if he had the time-table, or the menu, or
      whitever ye ca&rsquo;t, to keep him richt?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Wha&rsquo; couldna&rsquo; sell coal,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;if he had the jaw for&rsquo;t? Man, Duffy,&rsquo; 
      says I, &lsquo;I never see ye openin&rsquo; your mooth to roar coal up a close but I
      wonder whit wye there should be sae much talk in the Gleska Toon Cooncil
      aboot the want o&rsquo; vacant spaces.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Duffy&rsquo;s failin&rsquo;; there&rsquo;s nae doot o&rsquo;t. He has a hump on him wi&rsquo; carryin&rsquo; 
      bags o&rsquo; chape coal and dross up thae new, genteel, tiled stairs, and he
      let&rsquo;s on it&rsquo;s jist a knot in his gallowses, but I ken better. I&rsquo;m as
      straucht as a wand mysel&rsquo;&mdash;faith, I micht weel be, for a&rsquo; that I get
      to cairry hame frae ony o&rsquo; the dinners nooadays. I&rsquo;ve seen the day, when
      Blythswood Square and roond aboot it was a&rsquo; the go, that it was coonted
      kind o&rsquo; scrimp to let a waiter hame withoot a heel on him like yin o&rsquo; thae
      Clyde steamers gaun oot o&rsquo; Rothesay quay on a Fair Settu&rsquo;rday.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Noo they&rsquo;ll ripe your very hip pooches for fear ye may be takin&rsquo; awa&rsquo; a
      daud o&rsquo; custard, or the toasted crumbs frae a dish o&rsquo; pheasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They needna&rsquo; be sae awfu&rsquo; feart, some o&rsquo; them. I ken their dinners&mdash;cauld,
      clear, bane juice, wi&rsquo; some strings o&rsquo; vermicelli in&rsquo;t; ling-fish hash; a
      spoonfu&rsquo; o&rsquo; red-currant jeely, wi&rsquo; a piece o&rsquo; mutton the size o&rsquo; a domino
      in&rsquo;t, if ye had time to find it, only ye&rsquo;re no&rsquo; playin&rsquo; kee-hoi; a game
      croquette that&rsquo;s jist a flaff o&rsquo; windy paste; twa cheese straws; four
      green grapes, and a wee lend o&rsquo; a pair o&rsquo; silver nut-crackers, the wife o&rsquo; 
      the hoose got at her silver weddin&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man! it&rsquo;s a rale divert! I see big, strong, healthy Bylies and members o&rsquo; 
      the Treds&rsquo; Hoose and the Wine, Speerit, and Beer Tred risin&rsquo; frae dinners
      like that, wi&rsquo; their big, braw, gold watch-chains hingin&rsquo; doon to their
      knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I tell Jinnet mony a time, it&rsquo;s women that hae fair ruined
      dinner-parties in oor generation. They tak&rsquo; the measure o&rsquo; the appetities
      o&rsquo; mankind by their ain, which hae been a&rsquo;thegether spoiled wi&rsquo; efternoon
      tea, and they think a man can mak&rsquo; up wi&rsquo; music in the drawin&rsquo;-room for
      whit he didna get at the dinner-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a temperate man mysel&rsquo;, and hae to be, me bein&rsquo; a beadle, but I
      whiles wish we had back the auld days I hae read aboot, when a laddie was
      kept under the table to lowse the grauvats o&rsquo; the gentlemen that fell
      under&rsquo;t, in case they should choke themsel&rsquo;s. Scotland was Scotland then!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they choked noo, in some places I&rsquo;ve been in, it wad be wi&rsquo; thirst.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The last whisk o&rsquo; the petticoat&rsquo;s no roon&rsquo; the stair-landin&rsquo; when the man
      o&rsquo; the hoose puts the half o&rsquo; his cigarette bye for again, and says, &lsquo;The
      ladies will be wonderin&rsquo; if we&rsquo;ve forgotten them,&rsquo; and troosh a&rsquo; the puir
      deluded craturs afore him up the stair into the drawin&rsquo;-room where his
      wife Eliza&rsquo;s maskin&rsquo; tea, and a lady wi&rsquo; tousy hair&rsquo;s kittlin&rsquo; the piano
      till it&rsquo;s sair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Whit&rsquo;s your opinion about Tschaikovski?&rsquo; I heard a wumman ask a Bylie at
      a dinner o&rsquo; this sort the ither nicht.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I never heard o&rsquo; him,&rsquo; said the Bylie, wi&rsquo; a gant, &lsquo;but if he&rsquo;s in the
      proveesion tred, there&rsquo;ll be an awfu&rsquo; run on his shop the morn&rsquo;s morn&rsquo;.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anither thing that has helped to spoil oor tred is the smokin&rsquo; concerts.
      I tak&rsquo; a draw o&rsquo; the pipe mysel&rsquo; whiles, but I never cared to mak&rsquo; a meal
      o&rsquo;t. Noo and then when I&rsquo;m no&rsquo; very busy other ways I gie a hand at a
      smoker, and it mak&rsquo;s me that gled I got ower my growth afore the thing
      cam&rsquo; into fashion; but it&rsquo;s gey sair on an auld man to hear &lsquo;Queen o&rsquo; the
      Earth&rsquo; five or six nichts in the week, and the man at the piano aye tryin&rsquo; 
      to guess the richt key, or to get done first, so that the company&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; 
      rin awa&rsquo; when he&rsquo;s no&rsquo; lookin&rsquo; withoot paying him his five shillin&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done the waitin&rsquo; at a&rsquo; kinds o&rsquo; jobs in my time,&mdash;Easy-gaun
      Erchie they ca&rsquo; me sometimes in the tred&mdash;a flet fit but a warm hert;
      I&rsquo;ve even handed roond seed-cake and a wee drap o&rsquo; spirits at a burial,
      wi&rsquo; a bereaved and mournfu&rsquo; mainner that greatly consoled the weedow; but
      there&rsquo;s nae depths in the business so low as poo&rsquo;in&rsquo; corks for a smokin&rsquo; 
      concert. And the tips get smaller and smaller every ane I gang to. At
      first we used to get them in a schooner gless; then it cam&rsquo; doon to a wee
      tumbler; and the last I was at I got the bawbees in an egg-cup.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      IV THE BURIAL OF BIG MACPHEE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">E</span>rchie looked
      pityingly at Big Macphee staggering down the street. &ldquo;Puir sowl!&rdquo; said he,
      &ldquo;whit&rsquo;s the maitter, wi&rsquo; ye noo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Big Macphee looked up, and caught his questioner by the coat collar to
      steady himself. &ldquo;Beer,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;jist beer. Plain beer, if ye want to
      ken. It&rsquo;s no&rsquo; ham and eggs, I&rsquo;ll bate ye. Beer, beer, glorious beer; I&rsquo;m
      shair I&rsquo;ve perished three gallons this very day. Three gallons hiv I in
      me, I&rsquo;ll wager.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye wad be far better to cairry it hame in a pail,&rdquo; said Erchie. &ldquo;Man, I&rsquo;m
      rale vexed to see a fine, big, smert chap like you gaun hame like this,
      takin&rsquo; the breadth o&rsquo; the street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hiv I no&rsquo; a richt to tak&rsquo; the breadth o&rsquo; the street if I want it?&rdquo; said
      Big Macphee. &ldquo;Am I no&rsquo; a ratepayer? I hiv a ludger&rsquo;s vote, and I&rsquo;m gaun to
      vote against Joe Chamberlain and the dear loaf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Och! ye needna fash aboot the loaf for a&rsquo; the difference a tax on&rsquo;t&rsquo;ll
      mak&rsquo; to you,&rdquo; said Erchie. &ldquo;If ye gang on the wye ye&rsquo;re daein&rsquo; wi&rsquo; the
      beer, it&rsquo;s the Death Duties yer freends&rsquo;ll be bothered aboot afore lang.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he led the erring one home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Big Macphee was the man who for some months back had done the shouting for
      Duffy&rsquo;s lorry No. 2. He sustained the vibrant penetrating quality, of a
      voice like the Cloch fog-horn on a regimen consisting of beer and the
      casual hard-boiled egg of the Mull of Kintyre Vaults. He had no relatives
      except a cousin &ldquo;oot aboot Fintry,&rdquo; and when he justified Erchie&rsquo;s gloomy
      prediction about the Death Duties by dying of pneumonia a week afterwards,
      there was none to lament him, save in a mild, philosophical way, except
      Erchie&rsquo;s wife, Jinnet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jinnet, who could never sleep at night till she heard Macphee go up the
      stairs to his lodgings, thought the funeral would be scandalously cold and
      heartless lacking the customary &ldquo;tousy tea&rdquo; to finish up with, and as
      Duffy, that particular day, was not in a position to provide this solace
      for the mourners on their return from Sighthill Cemetery, she invited them
      to her house. There were Duffy and a man Macphee owed money to; the cousin
      from &ldquo;oot aboot Fintry&rdquo; and his wife, who was, from the outset, jealous of
      the genteel way tea was served in Jinnet&rsquo;s parlour, and suspicious of a
      &ldquo;stuckupness&rdquo; that was only in her own imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a nesty, wat, mochy, melancholy day for a burial,&rdquo; said Duffy
      at the second helping of Jinnet&rsquo;s cold boiled ham; &ldquo;Macphee was jist as
      weel oot o&rsquo;t. He aye hated to hae to change his jaicket afore the last
      rake, him no&rsquo; haein&rsquo; ony richt wumman buddy aboot him to dry&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Och, the puir cratur!&rdquo; said Jinnet. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like enough he had a
      disappointment ance upom a time. He was a cheery chap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a&rsquo; that,&rdquo; said Duffy. &ldquo;See&rsquo;s the haud o&rsquo; the cream-poorie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cousin&rsquo;s wife felt Jinnet&rsquo;s home-baked seedcake was a deliberate taunt
      at her own inefficiency in the baking line. She sniffed as she nibbled it
      with a studied appearance of inappreciation. &ldquo;It wasna a very cheery
      burial he had, onyway,&rdquo; was her astounding comment, and at that Erchie
      winked to himself, realising the whole situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re richt there, Mistress Grant,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Burials are no&rsquo; whit they
      used to be. &lsquo;Perhaps&mdash;perhaps ye were expectin&rsquo; a brass band?&rdquo; and at
      that the cousin&rsquo;s wife saw this was a different man from her husband, and
      that there was a kind of back-chat they have in Glasgow quite unknown in
      Fintry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I wasna sayin&rsquo; onything aboot brass bands,&rdquo; she retorted, very
      red-faced, and looking over to her husband for his support. He, however,
      was too replete with tea and cold boiled ham for any severe intellectual
      exercise, and was starting to fill his pipe. &ldquo;I wasna saying onything
      aboot brass bands; we&rsquo;re no&rsquo; used to thae kind o&rsquo; operatics at burials
      whaur I come frae. But I think oor ain wye o&rsquo; funerals is better than the
      Gleska wye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Erchie (fearful for a moment that something might have been overlooked)
      glanced at the fragments of the feast, and at the spirit-bottle that had
      discreetly circulated somewhat earlier. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re daein&rsquo; the best we can,&rdquo;
       said he. &ldquo;As shair as death your kizzen&mdash;peace be wi&rsquo; him!&mdash;&lsquo;s
      jist as nicely buried as if ye paid for it yersel&rsquo; instead o&rsquo; Duffy and&mdash;and
      Jinnet; if ye&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; believe me ye can ask your man. &lsquo;Nae doot Big Macphee
      deserved as fine a funeral as onybody, wi&rsquo; a wheen coaches, and a service
      at the kirk, wi&rsquo; the organ playin&rsquo; and a&rsquo; that, but that wasna the kind o&rsquo; 
      man your kizzen was when he was livin&rsquo;. He hated a&rsquo; kinds o&rsquo; falderals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a cheery chap,&rdquo; said Jinnet again, nervously, perceiving some
      electricity in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he micht hae had a nicer burial,&rdquo; said the cousin&rsquo;s wife, with
      firmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Preserve us!&rdquo; cried Erchie. &ldquo;Whit wad ye like?&mdash;Flags maybe? Or
      champagne wine at the liftin&rsquo;? Or maybe wreaths o&rsquo; floo&rsquo;ers? If it was
      cheeriness ye were wantin&rsquo; wi&rsquo; puir Macphee, ye should hae come a month
      ago and he micht hae ta&rsquo;en ye himsel&rsquo; to the Britannia Music-ha&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haud yer tongue, Erchie,&rdquo; said Jinnet; and the cousin&rsquo;s wife, as fast as
      she could, took all the hair-pins out of her head and put them in again,&mdash;&ldquo;They
      think we&rsquo;re that faur back in Fintry,&rdquo; she said with fine irrelevance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Erchie, who saw his innocent wife was getting all the
      cousin&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s fierce glances, &ldquo;Not at all, mem. There&rsquo;s naething wrang
      wi&rsquo; Fintry; mony a yin I&rsquo;ve sent there. I&rsquo;m rale chawed we didna hae a
      Fintry kind o&rsquo; funeral, to please ye. Whit&rsquo;s the patent thing aboot a
      Fintry funeral?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For wan thing,&rdquo; said the cousin&rsquo;s wife, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s aye a rale hearse we hae at
      Fintry and no&rsquo; a box under a machine, like thon. It was jist a disgrace.
      Little did his mither think it wad come to thon. Ye wad think it was
      coals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And whit&rsquo;s the maitter wi&rsquo; coals?&rdquo; cried Duffy, his professional pride
      aroused. &ldquo;Coals was his tred. Ye&rsquo;re shairly awfu&rsquo; toffs in Fintry aboot
      yer funerals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cousin&rsquo;s wife stabbed her head all over again with her hair-pins, and
      paid no heed to him. Her husband evaded her eyes with great determination.
      &ldquo;No&rsquo; that great toffs either,&rdquo; she retorted, &ldquo;but we can aye afford a bit
      crape. There wasna a sowl that left this close behind the corp the day had
      crape in his hat except my ain man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the man to whom Big Macphee owed money laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Crape&rsquo;s oot o&rsquo; date, mistress,&rdquo; Erchie assured her. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no&rsquo; the go noo
      at a&rsquo; in Gleska; ye micht as weel expect to see the auld saulies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weel, it&rsquo;s the go enough in Fintry,&rdquo; said the cousin&rsquo;s wife. &ldquo;And there
      was anither thing; I didna expect to see onybody else but my man in
      weepers, him bein&rsquo; the only freen&rsquo; puir Macphee had but&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I havena seen weepers worn since the year o&rsquo; the Tay Bridge,&rdquo; said
      Erchie, &ldquo;and that was oot at the Mearns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weel, we aye hae them at Fintry,&rdquo; insisted the cousin&rsquo;s wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A cheery chap,&rdquo; said Jinnet again, at her wits&rsquo;-end to put an end to this
      restrained wrangling, and the man Big Macphee owed money to laughed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whit&rsquo;s mair,&rdquo; went on the cousin&rsquo;s wife, &ldquo;my man was the only wan there
      wi&rsquo; a dacent shirt wi&rsquo; Erchie tucks on the breist o&rsquo;t; the rest o&rsquo; ye had
      that sma&rsquo; respect for the deid ye went wi&rsquo; shirt-breists as flet as a
      sheet o&rsquo; paper. It was showin&rsquo; awfu&rsquo; sma&rsquo; respect for puir Macphee,&rdquo; and
      she broke down with her handkerchief at her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Och! ta bleezes! Jessie, ye&rsquo;re spilin&rsquo; a&rsquo; the fun,&rdquo; her husband
      remonstrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Erchie pushed back his chair and made an explanation. &ldquo;Tucks is no&rsquo; the go
      naither, mistress,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and if ye kent whit the laundries were in
      Gleska ye wadna wonder at it. A laundry&rsquo;s a place whaur they&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; stand
      ony o&rsquo; yer tucks, or ony nonsense o&rsquo; that kind. Tucks wad spoil the teeth
      o&rsquo; the curry-combs they use in the laundry for scoorin&rsquo; the cuffs and
      collars; they&rsquo;re no&rsquo; gaun awa&rsquo; to waste the vitriol they use for bleachin&rsquo; 
      on a wheen tucks. They couldna dae&rsquo;t at the money; it&rsquo;s only threepence
      ha&rsquo;penny a shirt, ye ken, and oot o&rsquo; that they hae to pay for the machines
      that tak&rsquo;s the buttons aff, and the button-hole bursters&mdash;that&rsquo;s a
      tred by itsel&rsquo;. No, mem, tucked breists are oot o&rsquo; date; ye&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; see
      such a thing in Gleska; I&rsquo;m shair puir Macphee himsel&rsquo; hadna ane. The
      man&rsquo;s as weel buried as if we had a&rsquo; put on the kilts, and had a piper in
      front playin&rsquo; &lsquo;Lochaber no More.&rsquo; If ye&rsquo;ll no believe us, Duffy can show
      ye the receipted accoonts for the undertaker and the lair; can ye no&rsquo;,
      Duffy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smert!&rdquo; said Duffy,
    </p>
    <p>
      But the cousin&rsquo;s wife was not at all anxious to see accounts of any kind,
      so she became more prostrate with annoyance and grief than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oot Fintry way,&rdquo; said Erchie, exasperated, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a&rsquo; richt to keep up
      tucked shirt-breists, and crape, and weepers, and mort-cloths, and the
      like, for there canna be an awfu&rsquo; lot o&rsquo; gaiety in the place, but we have
      aye plenty o&rsquo; ither things to amuse us in Gleska. There&rsquo;s the Kelvingrove
      Museum, and the Wax-works. If ye&rsquo;re no&rsquo; pleased wi&rsquo; the wye Macphee was
      buried, ye needna gie us the chance again wi&rsquo; ony o&rsquo; yer freen&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cousin&rsquo;s wife addressed herself to her husband. &ldquo;Whit was yon ye were
      gaun to ask?&rdquo; she said to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got very red, and shifted uneasily in his chair. &ldquo;Me!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I
      forget.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No ye dinna; ye mind fine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Och, it&rsquo;s a&rsquo; richt. Are we no&rsquo; haein&rsquo; a fine time,&rdquo; protested the
      husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nor a&rsquo; richt, Rubbert Grant.&rdquo; She turned to the others, &ldquo;Whit my man
      was gaun to ask, if he wasna such a sumph, was whether oor kizzen hadna
      ony money put by him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If ye kent him better, ye wadna need to ask,&rdquo; said Duffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a cheery chap,&rdquo; said Jinnet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But was he no&rsquo; in the Shepherds, or the Oddfellows, or the Masons, or
      onything that wye?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nor in the Good Templars nor the Rechabites,&rdquo; said Erchie. &ldquo;The only
      thing the puir sowl was ever in was the Mull o&rsquo; Kintyre Vaults.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I no&rsquo; tell ye?&rdquo; said her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye and thenky the noo,&rdquo; said the cousin&rsquo;s wife, as she went down
      the stair. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve spent a rale nice day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only thing ye did spend,&rdquo; said Erchie when she was out of
      hearing. &ldquo;Funerals are managed gey chape in Fintry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh ye rascal, ye&rsquo;ve the sherp tongue!&rdquo; said Jinnet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, and there&rsquo;s some needs it! A flet fit, too, but a warm hert,&rdquo; said
      Erchie.

      V THE PRODIGAL SON
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">J</span>innet, like a wise
      housewife, aye, shops early on Saturday, but she always &ldquo;leaves some
      errand&mdash;some trifle overlooked, as it were&mdash;till the evening,
      for, true daughter of the-city, she loves at times the evening throng of
      the streets. That of itself, perhaps, would not send her out with her
      door-key in her hand and a peering, eager look like that of one expecting
      something long of coming: the truth is she cherishes a hope that some
      Saturday to Erchie and her will come what comes often to her in her
      dreams, sometimes with terror and tears, sometimes with delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I declare, Erchie, if I havena forgotten some sweeties for the kirk the
      morn,&rdquo; she says; &ldquo;put on yer kep and come awa&rsquo; oot wi&rsquo; me; ye&rsquo;ll be nane
      the waur o&rsquo; a breath o&rsquo; fresh air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Erchie-puts down his &lsquo;Weekly Mail,&rsquo; stifling a sigh and pocketing his
      spectacles. The night may be raw and wet, the streets full of mire, the
      kitchen more snug and clean and warm than any palace, but he never on such
      occasion says her nay. &ldquo;You and your sweeties!&rdquo; he exclaims, lacing his
      boots; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m shair ye never eat ony, in the kirk or onywhere else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And whit dae ye th&rsquo;ink I wad be buyin&rsquo; them for if it wasna to keep me
      frae gantin&rsquo; in the kirk when the sermon&rsquo;s dreich?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe for pappin&rsquo; at the cats in the back coort,&rdquo; he retorts. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s ae
      thing certain shair, I never see ye eatin&rsquo; them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, and ye&rsquo;re richt,&rdquo; she confesses. &ldquo;I havena the teeth for them
      nooadays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s naething wrang wi&rsquo; yer teeth, nor ony-thing else aboot ye that I
      can see,&rdquo; her husband replies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye auld haver!&rdquo; Jinnet will then cry, smiling. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s you that&rsquo;s lost yer
      sicht, I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m a done auld buddy, that&rsquo;s whit I am, and that&rsquo;s
      tellin&rsquo; ye. But haste ye and come awa&rsquo; for the sweeties wi&rsquo; me: whit&rsquo;ll
      thae wee Wilson weans in the close say the morn if Mrs MacPherson hasna
      ony sweeties for them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went along New City Road together, Erchie tall, lean, and a little
      round at the shoulders; his wife a little wee body, not reaching his
      shoulder, dressed, by-ordinar for her station and &ldquo;ower young for her
      years,&rdquo; as a few jealous neighbours say.
    </p>
    <p>
      An unceasing drizzle blurred the street-lamps, the pavement was slippery
      with mud; a night for the hearth-side and slippered feet on the fender,
      yet the shops were thronged, and men and women crowded the thoroughfare or
      stood entranced before the windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonnerfu&rsquo; place, Gleska,&rdquo; said Erchie. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s such diversion
      in&rsquo;t if ye&rsquo;re in the key for&rsquo;t. If ye hae yer health and yer wark, and the
      weans is weel, ye can be as happy as a lord, and far happier. It&rsquo;s the
      folk that live in the terraces where the nae stairs is, and sittin&rsquo; in
      their paurlours readin&rsquo; as hard&rsquo;s onything to keep up wi&rsquo; the times, and
      naething to see oot the window but a plot o&rsquo; grass that&rsquo;s no&rsquo; richt green,
      that gets tired o&rsquo; everything. The like o&rsquo; us, that stay up closes and hae
      nae servants, and can come oot for a daunder efter turnin&rsquo; the key in the
      door, hae the best o&rsquo;t. Lord! there&rsquo;s sae muckle to see&mdash;the
      cheeny-shops and the drapers, and the neighbours gaun for paraffin oil wi&rsquo; 
      a bottle, and Duffy wi&rsquo; a new shepherd-tartan grauvit, and Lord Macdonald
      singin&rsquo; awa&rsquo; like a&rsquo; that at the Normal School, and&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Erchie! dae ye mind when Willie was at the Normal?&rdquo; said Jinnet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my! here it is already,&rdquo; thought Erchie. &ldquo;If that laddie o&rsquo; oors kent
      the hertbrek he was to his mither,nI wonder wad he bide sae lang awa&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I mind, Jinnet; I mind fine. Whit for need ye be askin&rsquo;? As I was
      sayin&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s aye in the common streets that things is happenin&rsquo; that&rsquo;s
      worth lookin&rsquo; at, if ye&rsquo;re game for fun. It&rsquo;s like travellin&rsquo; on the
      railway; if ye gang first-cless, the wey I did yince to Yoker by mistake,
      ye micht as weel be in a hearse for a&rsquo; ye see or hear; but gang third and
      ye&rsquo;ll aye find something to keep ye cheery if it&rsquo;s only fifteen chaps
      standin&rsquo; on yer corns gaun to a fitba&rsquo;-match, or a man in the corner o&rsquo; 
      the cairrage wi&rsquo; a mooth-harmonium playin&rsquo; a&rsquo; the wye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Erchie, look at the puir wean,&rdquo; said Jinnet, turning to glance after
      a woman with an infant in her arms. &ldquo;Whit a shame bringin&rsquo; oot weans on a
      nicht like this! Its face is blae wi&rsquo; the cauld.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Och! never mind the weans,&rdquo; said her husband; &ldquo;if ye were to mind a&rsquo; the
      weans ye see in Gleska, ye wad hae a bonnie job o&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But jist think on the puir wee smout, Erchie. Oh, dear me! there&rsquo;s
      anither yin no&rsquo; three months auld, I&rsquo;ll wager. It&rsquo;s a black-burnin&rsquo; shame.
      It should be hame snug and soond in its wee bed. Does&rsquo;t no&rsquo; mind ye o&rsquo; 
      Willy when I took him first to his grannie&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her husband growled to himself, and hurried his step; but that night there
      seemed to be a procession of women with infants in arms in New City Road,
      and Jinnet&rsquo;s heart was wrung at every crossing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thocht it was pan-drops ye cam&rsquo; oot for, or conversation- losengers,&rdquo;
       he protested at last; &ldquo;and here ye&rsquo;re greetin&rsquo; even-on aboot a wheen weans
      that&rsquo;s no&rsquo; oor fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re a hard-herted monster, so ye are,&rdquo; said his wife indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I am,&rdquo; he confessed blythely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll throw aff a&rsquo; disguise and
      admit my rale name&rsquo;s Blue-beard, but don&rsquo;t tell the polis on me.
      Hard-herted monster&mdash;I wad need to be wi&rsquo; a wife like you, that canna
      see a wean oot in the street at nicht withoot the drap at yer e&rsquo;e. The
      weans is maybe no&rsquo; that bad aff: the nicht air&rsquo;s no&rsquo; waur nor the day air:
      maybe when they&rsquo;re oot here they&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; mind they&rsquo;re hungry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Erchie! see that puir wee lame yin! God peety him!&mdash;I maun gie
      him a penny,&rdquo; whispered Jinnet, as a child in rags stopped before a
      jeweller&rsquo;s window to look in on a magic world of silver cruet-stands and
      diamond rings and gold watches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll dae naething o&rsquo; the kind!&rdquo; said Erchie. &ldquo;It wad jist be wastin&rsquo; yer
      money; I&rsquo;ll bate ye onything his mither drinks.&rdquo; He pushed his wife on her
      way past the boy, and, unobserved by her, slipped twopence in the latter&rsquo;s
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen the day ye werena sae mean, Erchie MacPherson,&rdquo; said his wife,
      vexatiously. &ldquo;Ye aye brag o&rsquo; yer flet fit and yer warm hert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s jist a sayin&rsquo;; I&rsquo;m as mooly&rsquo;s onything,&rdquo; said Erchie, and winked to
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not the children of the city alone that engaged Jinnet&rsquo;s attention;
      they came to a street where now and then a young man would come from a
      public-house staggering; she always scanned the young fool&rsquo;s face with
      something of expectancy and fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jist aboot his age, Erchie,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Oh, dear! I wonder if that
      puir callan&rsquo; has a mither,&rdquo; and she stopped to look after the young man in
      his cups.
    </p>
    <p>
      Erchie looked too, a little wistfully &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager ye he has,&rdquo; said he.
      &ldquo;And like enough a guid yin; that&rsquo;s no&rsquo; forgettin&rsquo; him, though he may gang
      on the ran-dan; but in her bed at nicht no&rsquo; sleepin&rsquo;, wonderin&rsquo; whit&rsquo;s
      come o&rsquo; him, and never mindin&rsquo; onything that was bad in him, but jist a
      kind o&rsquo; bein&rsquo; easy-led, but mindin&rsquo; hoo smert he was when he was but a
      laddie, and hoo he won the prize for composeetion in the school, and hoo
      prood he was when he brocht hame the first wage he got on a Setturday. If
      God Almichty has the same kind o&rsquo; memory as a mither, Jinnet, there&rsquo;ll be
      a chance at the hinderend for the warst o&rsquo; us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had gone at least a mile from home, the night grew wetter and more
      bitter, the crowds more squalid, Jinnet&rsquo;s interest in errant belated youth
      more keen. And never a word of the sweets she had made believe to come out
      particularly for. They had reached the harbour side; the ships lay black
      and vacant along the wharfs, noisy seamen and women debauched passed in
      groups or turned into the public-houses. Far west, into the drizzling
      night the river lamps stretched, showing the drumly water of the highway
      of the world. Jinnet stopped and looked and listened. &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re far
      enough, Erchie; I think we&rsquo;ll jist gang hame,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right!&rdquo; said Erchie, patiently; and they turned, but not without one sad
      glance from his wife before they lost sight of the black ships, the noisy
      wharves, the rolling seamen on the pavement, the lamplights of the watery
      way that reaches to the world&rsquo;s end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Erchie,&rdquo; she said piteously, &ldquo;I wonder if he&rsquo;s still on the ships.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like enough,&rdquo; said her husband. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m shair he&rsquo;s no&rsquo; in Gleska at onyrate
      without conin&rsquo; to see us. I&rsquo;ll bate ye he&rsquo;s a mate or a captain or a
      purser or something, and that thrang somewhere abroad he hasna time the
      noo; but we&rsquo;ll hear frae him by-and-bye. The wee deevil! I&rsquo;ll gie him&rsquo;t
      when I see him, to be givin&rsquo; us such a fricht.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&rsquo; that wee, Erchie,&rdquo; said Jinnet. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s bigger than yersel&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he is, the rascal! am I no&rsquo; aye thinkin&rsquo; o&rsquo; him jist aboot the age he
      was when he was at the Sunday school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hoo lang is&rsquo;t since we heard o&rsquo; him, Erchie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three or four years, or maybe five,&rdquo; said Erchie, quickly. &ldquo;Man! the wye
      time slips bye! It doesna look like mair nor a twelvemonth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks to me like twenty year,&rdquo; said Jinnet, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s naething less
      than seeven, for it was the year o&rsquo; Annie&rsquo;s weddin&rsquo;, and her wee Alick&rsquo;s
      six at Mertinmas. Seeven years! Oh, Erchie, where can he be? Whit can be
      wrang wi&rsquo; him? No&rsquo; to write a scrape o&rsquo; a pen a&rsquo; that time! Maybe I&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; 
      be spared to see him again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bate ye whit ye like ye will,&rdquo; said her husband. &ldquo;And if he doesna
      bring ye hame a lot o&rsquo; nice things&mdash;shells and parrots, and bottles
      of scent, and Riga Balsam for hacked hands, and the rale Cheena cheeny,
      and ostrich feathers and a&rsquo; that, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be awfu&rsquo; wild at him.
      But the first thing I&rsquo;ll dae&rsquo;ll be to stand behind the door and catch him
      when he comes in, and tak&rsquo; the strap to him for the rideeculous wye he
      didna write to us.&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;Seeven years,&rdquo; said Jinnet. &ldquo;Oh, that weary sea, a puir trade to be
      followin&rsquo; for ony mither&rsquo;s son. It was Australia he wrote frae last;
      whiles I&rsquo;m feared the blecks catched him oot there and killed him in the
      Bush.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! nor the Bush! Jist let them try it wi&rsquo; oor Willie! Dod! he would put
      the hems on them; he could wrastle a score o&rsquo; blecks wi&rsquo; his least wee bit
      touch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Erchie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weel, Jinnet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; be angry wi&rsquo; me; but wha was it tellt ye they saw him twa years
      syne carryin&rsquo; on near the quay, and that he was stayin&rsquo; at the Sailors&rsquo; 
      Home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Duffy,&rdquo; said Erchie, hurriedly. &ldquo;I have a guid mind to&mdash;to
      kick him for sayin&rsquo; onything o&rsquo; the kind. I wad hae kicked him for&rsquo;t afore
      this if&mdash;if I wasna a beadle in the kirk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m shair it wasna oor Willie at a&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Jinnet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oor Willie! Dae ye think the laddie&rsquo;s daft, to be in Gleska and no&rsquo; come
      to see his mither?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I canna believe he wad dae&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Jinnet, but always looked intently in
      the face of every young man who passed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weel, that&rsquo;s ower for anither Setturday,&rdquo; said Erchie to himself,
      resuming his slippers and his spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I declare, wife,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;ye&rsquo;ve forgotten something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whit is&rsquo;t?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sweeties ye went oot for,&rdquo; said Erchie, solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear me! amn&rsquo;t I the silly yin? Thinkin&rsquo; on that Willie o&rsquo; oors puts
      everything oot o&rsquo; my heid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Erchie took a paper bag from his pocket and handed it to her. &ldquo;There ye
      are,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I had them in my pooch since dinner-time. I kent ye wad be
      needin&rsquo; them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And ye never let on, but put on your boots and cam&rsquo; awa&rsquo; oot wi&rsquo; me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of coorse I did; I&rsquo;m shairly no&rsquo; that auld but I can be gled on an excuse
      for a walk oot wi&rsquo; my lass?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Erchie! Erchie!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;when will ye be wise? I think I&rsquo;ll put
      on the kettle and mak&rsquo; a cup o&rsquo; tea to ye.&rdquo;

      VI MRS DUFFY DESERTS HER MAN
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hey&rsquo;re yatterin&rsquo; 
      awa&rsquo; in the papers there like sweetie-wives aboot Carlyle and his wife,&rdquo;
       said Erchie. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no&rsquo; the thing at a&rsquo; makin&rsquo; an exposure. I kent Carlyle
      fine; he had a wee baker&rsquo;s shop in Balmano Brae, and his wife made potted
      heid. It was quite clean; there was naething wrang wi&rsquo;t. If they
      quarrelled it was naebody&rsquo;s business but their ain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a gey droll hoose whaur there&rsquo;s no&rsquo; whiles a rippit. Though my fit&rsquo;s
      flet my hert&rsquo;s warm; but even me and Jinnet hae a cast-oot noo and then.
      I&rsquo;m aye the mair angry if I ken I&rsquo;m wrang, and I&rsquo;ve seen me that bleezin&rsquo; 
      bad tempered that I couldna light my pipe, and we wadna speak to ane
      anither for oors and oors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll come to nicht, and me wi&rsquo; a job at waitin&rsquo; to gang to, and my
      collar that hard to button I nearly break my thoombs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a while Jinnet&rsquo;ll say naethin&rsquo;, and then she&rsquo;ll cry, &lsquo;See&rsquo;s a haud
      o&rsquo;t, ye auld fuiter!&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll be glowerin&rsquo; awfu&rsquo; solemn up at the corner o&rsquo; 
      the ceilin&rsquo; when she&rsquo;s workin&rsquo; at the button, lettin&rsquo; on I&rsquo;m fair
      ferocious yet, and she&rsquo;ll say, Whit are ye glowerin&rsquo; at? Dae ye see ony
      spiders&rsquo; webs?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No, nor spiders&rsquo; webs,&rsquo; I says, as gruff as onything. &lsquo;I never saw a
      spider&rsquo;s web in this hoose.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At that she gets red in the face and tries no&rsquo; to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;There ye are laughin&rsquo;! Ye&rsquo;re bate!&rsquo; I says.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So are you laughin&rsquo;,&rsquo; says she; &lsquo;and I saw ye first. Awa&rsquo;, ye&rsquo;re daft!
      Will I buy onything tasty for your supper?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Duffy&rsquo;s different. I&rsquo;m no&rsquo; blamin&rsquo; him, for his wife&rsquo;s different too.
      When they quarrel it scandalises the close and gies the land a bad name.
      The wife washes even-on, and greets into her washin&rsquo;-byne till she mak&rsquo;s
      the water cauld, and Duffy sits a&rsquo; nicht wi&rsquo; his feet on the kitchen-hobs
      singin&rsquo; &lsquo;Boyne Water,&rsquo; because her mither was a Bark, called M&rsquo;Ginty, and
      cam&rsquo; frae Connaught. The folk in the flet abin them hae to rap doon at
      them wi&rsquo; a poker afore they&rsquo;ll get their nicht&rsquo;s sleep, and the broken
      delf that gangs oot to the ash-pit in the mornin&rsquo; wad fill a crate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no&rsquo; sayin&rsquo;, mind ye, that Duffy doesna like her; it&rsquo;s jist his wye,
      for he hasna ony edication. He was awfu&rsquo; vexed the time she broke her leg;
      it pit him aff his wark for three days, and he spent the time lamentin&rsquo; 
      aboot her doon in the Mull o&rsquo; Kintyre Vaults.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The biggest row they ever had that I can mind o&rsquo; was aboot the time the
      weemen wore the dolmans. Duffy&rsquo;s wife took the notion o&rsquo; a dolman, and
      told him that seein&rsquo; there was a bawbee up in the bag o&rsquo; coal that week
      she thocht he could very weel afford it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a lot o&rsquo; things we&rsquo;ll hae to get afore the dolman,&rsquo; says he;
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m needin&rsquo; a new kep mysel&rsquo;, and I&rsquo;m in a menoj for a bicycle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m fair affronted wi&rsquo; my claes,&rsquo; says she; &lsquo;I havena had onything new
      for a year or twa, and there&rsquo;s Carmichael&rsquo;s wife wi&rsquo; her, sealskin
      jaicket.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Let her!&rsquo; says Duffy; &lsquo;wi&rsquo; a face like thon she&rsquo;s no&rsquo; oot the need o&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They started wi&rsquo; that and kept it up till the neighbours near brocht doon
      the ceilin&rsquo; on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s the worst o&rsquo; leevin&rsquo; in a close,&rsquo; said Duffy, &lsquo;ye daurna show
      ye&rsquo;re the maister in yer ain hoose withoot a lot o&rsquo; nyafs above ye spilin&rsquo; 
      a&rsquo; the plaister.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Duffy&rsquo;s wife left him the very next day, and went hame to her mither&rsquo;s.
      She left oot clean sox for him and a bowl o&rsquo; mulk on the dresser in case
      he micht be hungry afore he could mak&rsquo; his ain tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Duffy cam&rsquo; hame and found whit had happened, he was awfu&rsquo; vexed for
      himsel&rsquo; and begood to greet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard aboot the thing, and went in to see him, and found him drinkin&rsquo; 
      the mulk and eatin&rsquo; shaves o&rsquo; breid at twa bites to the shave the same as
      if it was for a wager.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t this an awfu&rsquo; thing that&rsquo;s come on me, MacPherson?&rsquo; says he; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
      nae better nor a weedower except for the mournin&rsquo;s.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It hasna pit ye aff yer meat onywye, says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;ye may think I&rsquo;m callous, but I hae been greetin&rsquo; for twa
      oors afore I could tak&rsquo; a bite, and I&rsquo;m gaun to start again as soon as I&rsquo;m
      done wi&rsquo; this mulk.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ye should gang oot,&rsquo; I tells him, &lsquo;and buy the mistress a poke o&rsquo; grapes
      and gang roond wi&rsquo;t to her mither&rsquo;s and tell her ye&rsquo;re an eediot and canna
      help it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But wad he? No fears o&rsquo; him!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh! I can dae fine withoot her,&rsquo; he tells me quite cocky. &lsquo;I could keep
      a hoose wi&rsquo; my least wee bit touch.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ye puir deluded crature,&rsquo; I tell&rsquo;t him, &lsquo;ye micht as well try to keep a
      hyena. It looks gey like a collie-dug, but it&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; sup saps, and a hoose
      looks an awfu&rsquo; simple thing till ye try&rsquo;t; I ken fine because Jinnet aften
      tellt me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He begood to soop the floor wi&rsquo; a whitenin&rsquo;-brush, and put the stour
      under the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Go on,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;ye&rsquo;re daein&rsquo; fine for a start. A&rsquo; ye want&rsquo;s a week or
      twa at the nicht-schools, where they learn ye laundry-work and cookin&rsquo;,
      and when ye&rsquo;re at it ye should tak&rsquo; lessons in scientific dressmakin&rsquo;.
      I&rsquo;ll look for ye comin&rsquo; up the street next week wi&rsquo; the charts under your
      oxter and your lad wi&rsquo; ye.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a hale week Duffy kept his ain hoose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He aye forgot to buy sticks for the fire at nicht, and had to mak&rsquo; it in
      the mornin&rsquo; wi&rsquo; a dizzen or twa o&rsquo; claes-pins. He didna mak&rsquo; tea, for he
      couldna tak&rsquo; tea withoot cream till&rsquo;t, and he couldna get cream because he
      didna ken the wye to wash a poorie, so he made his breakfast o&rsquo; cocoa and
      his tea o&rsquo; cocoa till he was gaun aboot wi&rsquo; a broon taste in his mooth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the Sunday he tried to mak&rsquo; a dinner, and biled the plates wi&rsquo; soap
      and soda to get the creesh aff them when he found it wadna come aff wi&rsquo; 
      cauld water and a washin&rsquo;-clout.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Hoo are ye gettin&rsquo; on in yer ain bonny wee hoose noo?&rsquo; I asks him ae
      dirty, wet, cauld day, takin&rsquo; in a bowl o&rsquo; broth to him frae Jinnet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Fine,&rsquo; says he, quite brazen; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s jist like haein&rsquo; a yacht. I could be
      daein&rsquo; first-rate if it was the summer-time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wore them long kahoutchy boots up to your knees on wet days at his
      wark, and he couldna get them aff him withoot a hand frae his wife, so he
      had jist to gang to his bed wi&rsquo; them on. He ordered pipe-clay by the
      hunderwicht and soap by the yard; he blackleaded his boots, and didna gang
      to the kirk because he couldna get on his ain collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;;Duffy,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;ye&rsquo;ll mak&rsquo; an awfu&rsquo; nice auld wife if ye leeve lang
      enough. I&rsquo;ll hae to get Jinnet started to knit ye a Shetland shawl.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Efter a week it begood to tell awfu&rsquo; bad on Duffy&rsquo;s health. He got that
      thin, and so wake in the voice he lost orders, for a wheen o&rsquo; his auldest
      customers didna ken him when he cried, and gave a&rsquo; their tred to MacTurk,
      the coalman, that had a wife and twa sisters-in-law to coother him up wi&rsquo; 
      beef-tea on wet days and a&rsquo; his orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Duffy&rsquo;s mind was affected too; he gave the richt wicht, and lost twa
      chances in ae day o&rsquo; pittin&rsquo; a ha&rsquo;penny on the bag wi&rsquo; auld blin&rsquo; weemen
      that couldna read his board.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he ca&rsquo;d on a doctor. The doctor tellt him he couldna mak&rsquo; it oot at
      a&rsquo;, but thocht it was appen&mdash;what d&rsquo;ye ca&rsquo;t?&mdash;the same trouble
      as the King had, and that Duffy had it in five or six different places.
      There was naething for him but carefu&rsquo; dietin&rsquo; and a voyage to the Cape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That very day Duffy, gaun hame frae his wark gey shauchly, wi&rsquo; a tin o&rsquo; 
      salmon in his pooch for his tea, saw his wife comin&rsquo; doon the street. When
      she saw him she turned and ran awa&rsquo;, and him efter her as hard&rsquo;s he could
      pelt. She thocht he was that wild he was gaun to gie her a clourin&rsquo;; and
      she was jist fair bate wi&rsquo; the runnin&rsquo; when he caught up on her in a back
      coort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tig!&rsquo; says Duffy, touchin&rsquo; her; &lsquo;you&rsquo;re het!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, Jimmy!&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;are ye in wi&rsquo; me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Am I no&rsquo;?&rsquo; says Duffy, and they went hame thegither.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;There was a stranger in my tea this mornin&rsquo;,&rsquo; says Duffy: &lsquo;I kent fine
      somebody wad be comin&rsquo;.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His wife tellt Jinnet a while efter that that she was a great dale the
      better o&rsquo; the rest she got the time she went hame to her mither&rsquo;s; it was
      jist the very thing she was needin&rsquo;; and, forbye, she got the dolman.&rdquo;

      VII CARNEGIE&rsquo;S WEE LASSIE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">E</span>rchie sought me
      out on Saturday with a copy of that day&rsquo;s &lsquo;News&rsquo; containing a portrait of
      Carnegie&rsquo;s little daughter Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man, isn&rsquo;t she the rale wee divert?&rdquo; said he, glowing. &ldquo;That like her
      faither, and sae weel-put-on! She minds me terrible o&rsquo; oor wee Teenie when
      she was jist her age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has been born into an enviable state, Erchie,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m no&rsquo; sae shair aboot that,&rdquo; said Erchie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a gey hard thing, whiles, bein&rsquo; a millionaire&rsquo;s only wean. She canna
      hae mony wee lassies like hersel&rsquo; to play the peever wi&rsquo;, or lift things
      oot o&rsquo; the stanks o&rsquo; Skibo Castle wi&rsquo; a bit o&rsquo; clye and a string. I&rsquo;m
      shair it must be a hard job for the auld man, her paw, to provide
      diversions for the puir wee smout. And she&rsquo;ll hae that mony things that
      she&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; can say whit she wants next. I ken fine the wye it&rsquo;ll be up
      yonder at Skibo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be, &lsquo;Paw, I&rsquo;m wantin&rsquo; something.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Whit is&rsquo;t, my dawtie, and ye&rsquo;ll get it to break?&rsquo; Mr Carnegie&rsquo;ll say,
      and lift her on his knee, and let her play wi&rsquo; the works o&rsquo; his twa
      thoosand pound repeater watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I dinna&rsquo; ken,&rsquo; says the wee lassie, &lsquo;but I want it awfu&rsquo; fast.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Whit wad ye be sayin&rsquo; to an electric doll wi&rsquo; a phonograph inside it to
      mak&rsquo; it speak?&rsquo; asks Mr Carnegie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m tired o&rsquo; dolls,&rsquo; says the wee yin, &lsquo;and, besides, I wad raither dae
      the speakin&rsquo; mysel&rsquo;.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ye&rsquo;re a rale wee woman there, Maggie,&rsquo; says her paw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Weel, whit dae ye say to a wee totey motorcar a&rsquo; for your ain sel&rsquo;, and
      jewelled in four-and-twenty holes?&rsquo; says he efter that, takin&rsquo; the hands
      o&rsquo; his watch frae her in case she micht swallow them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh! a motor-car,&rsquo; says the wee lassie. &lsquo;No, I&rsquo;m no carin&rsquo; for ony mair
      motor-cars; &lsquo;I canna get takin&rsquo; them to my bed wi&rsquo; me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ye&rsquo;re weel aff there,&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve had the hale o&rsquo; the Pittsburg
      works to my bed wi&rsquo; me,&rsquo; he says. &lsquo;They were in my heid a&rsquo; the time when I
      couldna sleep, and they were on my chest a&rsquo; the time when I was sleepin&rsquo;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Whit wye that, paw?&rsquo; says the wee lassie. &ldquo;&lsquo;I was feart something wad
      gae wrang, and I wad lose a&rsquo; the tred, and be puir again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But I thocht ye wanted to die puir, paw?&rsquo; says the wee lassie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ay, but I never had ony notion o&rsquo; leevin&rsquo; puir,&rsquo; says Mr Carnegie as
      smert&rsquo;s ye like, &lsquo;and that mak&rsquo;s a&rsquo; the difference. If ye&rsquo;re, no&rsquo; for
      anither motor carriage, wad ye no&rsquo; tak&rsquo; a new watch?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No, paw,&rsquo; says the wee lassie, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m no&rsquo; for anither watch. The only
      thing a watch tells ye is when it&rsquo;s time to gang to bed, and then I&rsquo;m no
      wantin&rsquo; to gang onywye. Whit I wad like wad be ane o&rsquo; thae watches that
      has haunds that dinna move when ye&rsquo;re haein&rsquo; awfu&rsquo; fine fun.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, ay!&rsquo; says her paw at that; &lsquo;that&rsquo;s the kind we&rsquo;re a&rsquo; wantin&rsquo;, but
      they&rsquo;re no&rsquo; makin&rsquo; them, and I&rsquo;m no&rsquo; shair that I wad hae muckle use for
      yin nooadays eyen if they were. If ye&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; hae a watch, will ye hae a
      yacht, or a brass band, or a fleein&rsquo;-machine, or a piebald pony?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I wad raither mak&rsquo; mud-pies,&rsquo; says the wee innocent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Mud-pies!&rsquo; cries her faither in horror, lookin&rsquo; roond to see that
      naebody heard her. &lsquo;Wheesh! Maggie, it wadna look nice to see the like o&rsquo; 
      you makin&rsquo; mud-pies. Ye havena the claes for&rsquo;t. Beside, I&rsquo;m tellt they&rsquo;re
      no&rsquo; the go nooadays at a&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Weel,&rsquo; says she at that, &lsquo;I think I&rsquo;ll hae a hairy-heided lion.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Hairy-heided lion. Right!&rsquo; says Mr Carnegie. &lsquo;Ye&rsquo;ll get that, my wee
      lassie,&rdquo; and cries doon the turret stair to the kitchen for his No. 9
      secretary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The No. 9 secretary comes up in his shirt sleeves, chewin&rsquo; blot-sheet and
      dichting the ink aff his elbows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Whit are ye thrang at the noo?&rsquo; asks Mr Carnegie as nice as onything to
      him, though he&rsquo;s only a kind o&rsquo; a workin&rsquo; man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Sendin&rsquo; aff the week&rsquo;s orders for new kirk organs,&rsquo; says the No. 9
      secretary, &lsquo;and it&rsquo;ll tak&rsquo; us till Wednesday.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Where&rsquo;s a&rsquo; the rest o&rsquo; my secretaries?&rsquo; asks Mr Carnegie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Half o&rsquo; them&rsquo;s makin&rsquo; oot cheques for new leebraries up and doon the
      country, and the ither halfs oot in the back-coort burning letters frae
      weedows wi&rsquo; nineteen weans, nane o&rsquo; them daein&rsquo; for themsel&rsquo;s, and frae
      men that were dacent and steady a&rsquo; their days, but had awfu&rsquo; bad luck.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;If it gangs on like this we&rsquo;ll hae to put ye on the night-shift,&rsquo; says
      Mr Carnegie. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; to&rsquo;t when I hae to write my ain letters. I&rsquo;ll be
      expected to write my ain books next. But I&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; dae onything o&rsquo; the
      kind. Jist you telegraph to India, or Africa, or Japan, or wherever the
      hairy-heided lions comes frae, and tell them to send wee Maggie ane o&rsquo; the
      very best at 50 per cent aff for cash.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Early ae mornin&rsquo; some weeks efter that, when the steam-hooter for
      wakenin&rsquo; the secretaries starts howlin&rsquo; at five o&rsquo;clock, Mr Carnegie comes
      doon stair and sees the hairy-heided lion in a crate bein&rsquo; pit aff a
      lorry. He has it wheeled into the wee lassie when she&rsquo;s at her breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Let it oot,&rsquo; she says; &lsquo;I want to play wi&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ye wee fuiter!&rsquo; he says, lauchin&rsquo; like onything, &lsquo;ye canna get playin&rsquo; 
      wi&rsquo;t oot o&rsquo; the cage, but ye&rsquo;ll can get feedin&rsquo;t wi&rsquo; sultana-cake.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that disna suit wee Maggie, and she jist tells him to send it awa&rsquo; to
      the Bronx Zoo in New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Bronx Zoo. Right!&rsquo; says her paw, and cries on his No. 22 secretary to
      send it aff wi&rsquo; the parcel post at yince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That minds me,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s a cryin&rsquo; heed for hairy-heided lions
      all over Europe and the United States. The moral and educative influence
      o&rsquo; the common or bald-heided lion is of no account. Noo that maist o&rsquo; the
      kirks has twa organs apiece, and there&rsquo;s a leebrary in every clachan in
      the country, I must think o&rsquo; some ither wye o&rsquo; gettin&rsquo; rid o&rsquo; this cursed
      wealth. It was rale&rsquo; cute o&rsquo; you, Maggie, to think o&rsquo;t; I&rsquo;ll pay half the
      price o&rsquo; a hairy-heided lion for every toon in the country wi&rsquo; a
      population o&rsquo; over five hundred that can mak&rsquo; up the ither half by public
      subscription.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then the wee lassie says she canna tak&rsquo; her parridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Whit for no&rsquo;?&rsquo; he asks her, anxious-like. &lsquo;Are they no guid?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re maybe guid enough,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;but I wad raither hae
      toffie.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Toffie. Right!&rsquo; says her paw, and orders up the chef to mak&rsquo; toffie in a
      hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Whit&rsquo;s he gaun to mak&rsquo; it wi&rsquo;?&rsquo; asks the wee yin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, jist in the ordinar&rsquo; wye&mdash;wi&rsquo; butter and sugar,&rsquo; says her paw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s jist common toffie,&rsquo; says the wee lassie; &lsquo;I want some ither
      kind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;As shair&rsquo;s death, Maggie,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s only the ae wye o&rsquo; makin&rsquo; 
      toffie.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Then whit&rsquo;s the use o&rsquo; haein&rsquo; a millionaire for a paw?&rsquo; she asks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;True for you,&rsquo; he says, and thinks hard. &lsquo;I could mak&rsquo; the chef put in
      champed rubies or a di&rsquo;mond or twa grated doon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Wad it mak&rsquo; the toffie taste ony better?&rsquo; asks the wee cratur&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No&rsquo; a bit better,&rsquo; he says. &lsquo;It wadna taste sae guid as the ordinary
      toffie, but it wad be nice and dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Then I&rsquo;ll jist hae to hae the plain, chape toffie,&rsquo; says wee Maggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s jist whit I hae to hae mysel&rsquo; wi&rsquo; a great mony things,&rsquo; says her
      paw. &lsquo;Being a millionaire&rsquo;s nice enough some wyes, but there&rsquo;s a wheen
      things money canna buy, and paupers wi&rsquo; three or four thoosand paltry,
      pounds a-year is able to get jist as guid toffie and ither things as I
      can. I canna even dress mysel&rsquo; different frae ither folks, for it wad look
      rideeculous to see me gaun aboot wi&rsquo; gold cloth waistcoats and a hat wi&rsquo; 
      strings o&rsquo; pearls on it, so a&rsquo; I can dae is to get my nickerbocker suits
      made wi&rsquo; an extra big check. I hae the pattern that big noo there&rsquo;s only a
      check-and-a-half to the suit; but if it wasna for the honour o&rsquo;t I wad
      just as soon be wearin&rsquo; Harris tweed.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, Erchie,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you make me sorry for our philanthropic
      friend, and particularly for his little girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s no occasion!&rdquo; protested Erchie. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no condeetion in
      life that hasna its compensations, and even Mr Carnegie&rsquo;s wee lassie has
      them. I hae nae doot the best fun her and her paw gets is when they&rsquo;re
      playin&rsquo; at bein&rsquo; puir. The auld man&rsquo;ll nae doot whiles hide his
      pocket-money in the press, and sit doon readin&rsquo; his newspaper, wi&rsquo; his
      feet on the chimneypiece, and she&rsquo;ll come in and ask for a bawbee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I declare to ye I havena a farden, Maggie,&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll say; &lsquo;but I&rsquo;ll gie ye
      a penny on Setturday when I get my pay.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I dinna believe ye,&rsquo; she&rsquo;ll say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Then ye can ripe me,&rsquo; says her paw, and the wee tot&rsquo;ll feel in a&rsquo; his
      pooches, and find half a sovereign in his waistcoat. They&rsquo;ll let on it&rsquo;s
      jist a bawbee (the wee thing never saw a rale bawbee in her life, I&rsquo;ll
      warrant), and he&rsquo;ll wonner whit wye he forgot aboot it, and tell her to
      keep it and buy jujubes wi&rsquo;t, and she&rsquo;ll be awa&rsquo; like a whitteruck and
      come back in a while wi&rsquo; her face a&rsquo; sticky for a kiss, jist like rale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine I ken the wee smouts; it was that wye wi&rsquo; oor ain Teenie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Other whiles she&rsquo;ll hae a wee tin bank wi&rsquo; a bee-skep on&rsquo;t, and she&rsquo;ll
      hae&rsquo;t fu&rsquo; o&rsquo; sovereigns her faither&rsquo;s veesitors slip&rsquo;t in her haund when
      they were gaun awa&rsquo;, and she&rsquo;ll put it on the mantelpiece and gang out.
      Then her paw&rsquo;ll get up lauchin&rsquo; like onything to himsel&rsquo;, and tak&rsquo; doon
      the wee bank and rattle awa&rsquo; at it, lettin&rsquo; on he&rsquo;s robbin&rsquo;t for a
      schooner o&rsquo; beer, and at that she&rsquo;ll come rinnin&rsquo; in and catch him at it,
      and they&rsquo;ll hae great fun wi&rsquo; that game. I have nae doot her faither and
      mither get mony a laugh at her playin&rsquo; at wee washin&rsquo;s, too, and lettin&rsquo; 
      on she&rsquo;s fair trauchled aff the face o&rsquo; the earth wi&rsquo; a family o&rsquo; nine
      dolls, an&rsquo; three o&rsquo; them doon wi&rsquo; the hoopin&rsquo;-cough. Oh! they&rsquo;re no&rsquo; that
      bad aff for fine fun even in Skibo Castle.&rdquo;

      VIII A SON OF THE CITY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>y old friend came
      daundering down the street with what might have been a bag of cherries, if
      cherries were in season, and what I surmised were really the twopenny pies
      with which Jinnet and he sometimes made the Saturday evenings festive.
      When we met he displayed a blue hyacinth in a flower-pot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saw&rsquo;t in a fruiterer&rsquo;s window,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and took the notion. Ninepence;
      dod! I dinna ken hoo they mak&rsquo; them for the money. I thocht it wad please
      the wife, and min&rsquo; her o&rsquo; Dunoon and the Lairgs and a&rsquo; thae places that&rsquo;s
      doon the watter in the summer-time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye may say whit ye like, I&rsquo;m shair they shut up a&rsquo; thae coast toons when
      us bonny wee Gleska buddies is no&rsquo; comin&rsquo; doon wi&rsquo; oor tin boxes, and
      cheerin&rsquo; them up wi&rsquo; a clog-wallop on the quay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fine thing a flooer; no&rsquo; dear to buy at the start, and chaper to
      keep than a canary. It&rsquo;s Nature&mdash;the Rale Oreeginal. Ninepence! And
      the smell o&rsquo;t! Jist a fair phenomena!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sign of spring, Erchie,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;thank heaven! the primrose is in the
      wood, and the buds bursting on the hedge in the country, though you and I
      are not there to see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daursay,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hae to mak&rsquo; a perusal doon the length o&rsquo; Yoker
      on the skoosh car when the floods is ower. I&rsquo;m that used to them noo, as
      shair&rsquo;s death I canna get my naitural sleep on dry nichts unless Jinnet
      gangs oot to the back and throws chuckies at the window, lettin&rsquo; on it&rsquo;s
      rain and hailstanes. When I hear the gravel on the window I cod mysel&rsquo; 
      it&rsquo;s the genuine auld Caledonian climate, say my wee &lsquo;Noo I lay me,&rsquo; and
      gang to sleep as balmy as a nicht polisman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a great cry the noo aboot folks comin&rsquo; frae the country and
      croodin&rsquo; into the toons and livin&rsquo; in slums and degenerating the bone and
      muscle o&rsquo; Britain wi&rsquo; eatin&rsquo; kippered herrin&rsquo; and ice-cream. Thoosands o&rsquo; 
      them&rsquo;s gaun aboot Gleska daein&rsquo; their bit turns the best way they can, and
      no&rsquo; kennin&rsquo;, puir craturs! there&rsquo;s a Commission sittin&rsquo; on them as hard&rsquo;s
      it can.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Whit&rsquo;s wanted,&rsquo; says the Inspectors o&rsquo; Poor, &lsquo;is to hustle them aboot
      frae place to place till the soles o&rsquo; their feet gets red-hot wi&rsquo; the
      speed they&rsquo;re gaun at; then gie them a bar o&rsquo; carbolic soap and a keg o&rsquo; 
      Keatin&rsquo;s poother, and put them on the first train for Edinburgh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tear doon the rookeries,&rsquo; says anither man, &lsquo;and pit up rooms and
      kitchens wi&rsquo; wally jawboxes and tiled closes at a rent o&rsquo; eighteenpence
      a-week when ye get it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a&rsquo; very fine,&rsquo; says the economists, &lsquo;but if ye let guid wally
      jawbox hooses at ten shillin&rsquo;s a-year less than the auld-established and
      justly-popular slum hoose, will&rsquo;t no&rsquo; tempt mair puir folk frae the
      country into Gleska and conjest the Gorbals worse than ever?&rsquo; The puir
      economists thinks the folks oot aboot Skye and Kamerhash-injoo&rsquo;s waitin&rsquo; 
      for telegrams tellin&rsquo; them the single apairtment hoose in Lyon Street,
      Garscube Road,&rsquo;s doon ten shillin&rsquo;s a-year, afore they pack their
      carpet-bags and start on the Clansman for the Broomielaw. But they&rsquo;re no&rsquo;.
      They, divna ken onything aboot the rent o&rsquo; hooses in Gleska, and they&rsquo;re
      no&rsquo; carin&rsquo;, for maybe they&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; pay&rsquo;t ony-wye. They jist come awa&rsquo; to
      Gleska when the wife tells them, and Hughie&rsquo;s auld enough for a polisman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Slums! wha wants to abolish slums? It&rsquo;s no&rsquo;-the like o&rsquo; me nor Duffy. If
      there werena folk leevin&rsquo; in slums I couldna buy chape shirts, and the
      celebrated Stand Fast Craigroyston serge breeks at 2s. 11d. the pair,
      bespoke, guaranteed, shrunk, and wan hip-pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When they&rsquo;re proposin&rsquo; the toast o&rsquo; the &lsquo;Army, Navy, and Reserve Forces,&rsquo; 
      they ought to add the Force that live in Slums. They&rsquo;re the men and women
      that&rsquo;s aye ready to sweat for their country&mdash;when their money&rsquo;s done.
      A man that wants the chapest kind o&rsquo; chape labour kens he&rsquo;ll aye can get
      it in the slums; if it wasna for that, my Stand Fast Craigroyston breeks
      wad maybe cost 7s. 6d., and some of the elders in the kirk I&rsquo;m beadle for
      wad hae to smoke tuppenny cigars instead o&rsquo; sixpenny yins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The slums&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; touch ye if ye don&rsquo;t gang near them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whit a lot o&rsquo; folk want to dae&rsquo;s to run the skoosh cars away oot into the
      country whaur the clegs and the midges and the nae gas is, and coup them
      oot at Deid Slow on the Clyde, and leave them there wander&rsquo;t. Hoo wad they
      like it themsel&rsquo;s? The idea is that Duffy, when he&rsquo;s done wi&rsquo; his last
      rake o&rsquo; coals,&rsquo;ll mak&rsquo; the breenge for Deid Slow, and tak&rsquo; his tea and
      wash his face wi&rsquo; watter that hard it stots aff his face like a kahootchy
      ba&rsquo;, and spend a joyous and invigoratin&rsquo; evenin&rsquo; sheuchin&rsquo; leeks and
      prunin&rsquo; cauliflooer-bushes in the front plot o&rsquo; his cottage home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I see him! He wad faur sooner pay twelve pounds rent in Grove
      Street, and hae the cheery lowe o&rsquo; the Mull o&rsquo; Kintyre Vaults forenent his
      paurlor window, than get his boots a&rsquo; glaur wi&rsquo; plantin&rsquo; syboes roond his
      cottage home at £6, 10s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The country&rsquo;s a&rsquo; richt for folks that havena their health and dinna want
      to wear a collar to their wark, and Deid Slow and places like that may be
      fine for gaun to if ye want to get ower the dregs o&rsquo; the measles, but
      they&rsquo;re nae places for ony man that loves his fellow-men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And still there&rsquo;s mony a phenomena! I ken a man that says he wad stay in
      the country a&rsquo; the year roond if he hadna to bide in Gleska and keep his
      eye on ither men in the same tred&rsquo;s himsel&rsquo;, to see they&rsquo;re no&rsquo; risin&rsquo; 
      early in the mornin&rsquo; and gettin&rsquo; the better o&rsquo; him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wadna suit Easy-gaun Erchie. Fine I ken whit the country is; did I no&rsquo; 
      leeve a hale winter aboot Dairy when I was a halflin&rsquo;?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s maybe a&rsquo; richt in summer, when you and me gangs oot on an excursion,
      and cheers them up wi&rsquo; oor melodeon wi&rsquo; bell accompaniment; but the puir
      sowls havena much diversion at the time o&rsquo; year the V-shaped depression&rsquo;s
      deckin&rsquo; on Ben Nevis, and the weather prophets in the evening papers is
      promisin&rsquo; a welcome change o&rsquo; weather every Setturday. All ye can dae when
      your wark&rsquo;s done and ye&rsquo;ve ta&rsquo;en your tea&rsquo;s to put on a pair o&rsquo; top-boots
      and a waterproof, and gang oot in the dark. There&rsquo;s no&rsquo; even a close to
      coort in, and if ye want to walk alang a country road at nicht thinkin&rsquo; 
      hoo much money ye hae in the bank, ye must be gey smert no&rsquo; to fa&rsquo; into a
      ditch. Stars? Wha wants to bother glowerin&rsquo; at stars? There&rsquo;s never ony
      change in the programme wi&rsquo; them in the country. If I want stars I gang to
      the Britannia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Na, na, Gleska&rsquo;s the place, and it&rsquo;s nae wonder a&rsquo; the country-folks is
      croodin&rsquo; into&rsquo;t as fast&rsquo;s they can get their cottage homes sublet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the place for intellect and the big pennyworth of skim-milk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I declare I&rsquo;m that ta&rsquo;en wi&rsquo; Gleska I get up sometimes afore the fire&rsquo;s
      lichted to look oot at the window and see if it&rsquo;s still to the fore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fifteen, public-hooses within forty yairds o&rsquo; the close-mooth; a
      guttapercha works at the tap o&rsquo; the street, and twa cab-stances at the
      foot. My mornin&rsquo; &lsquo;oors are made merry wi&rsquo; the de-lightfu&rsquo; strains o&rsquo; 
      factory hooters and the sound o&rsquo; the dust-cart man kickin&rsquo; his horse like
      ony-thing whaur it&rsquo;ll dae maist guid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can get onywhere I want to gang on the skoosh cars for a bawbee or a
      penny, but the only place I hae to gang to generally is my wark, and I wad
      jist as soon walk it, for I&rsquo;m no in ony hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the rain&rsquo;s blashin&rsquo; doon at nicht on the puir miserable craturs
      workin&rsquo; at their front plots in Deid Slow, or trippin&rsquo; ower hens that&rsquo;ll
      no&rsquo; lay ony eggs, I can be improvin&rsquo; my mind wi&rsquo; Duffy at the Mull o&rsquo; 
      Kintyre Vaults, or daunderin&rsquo; alang the Coocaddens wi&rsquo; my hand tight on.
      my watch-pocket, lookin&rsquo; at the shop windows and jinkin&rsquo; the members o&rsquo; 
      the Sons of Toil Social Club (Limited), as they tak&rsquo; the breadth o&rsquo; the
      pavement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gleska! Some day when I&rsquo;m in the key for&rsquo;t I&rsquo;ll mak&rsquo; a song aboot her.
      Here the triumphs o&rsquo; civilisation meet ye at the stair-fit, and three
      bawbee mornin&rsquo; rolls can be had efter six o&rsquo;clock at nicht for a penny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s libraries scattered a&rsquo; ower the place; I ken, for I&rsquo;ve seen them
      often, and the brass plate at the door tellin&rsquo; ye whit they are.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Art&rsquo;s a&rsquo; the go in Gleska, too; there&rsquo;s something aboot it every ither
      nicht in the papers, when Lord Somebody-or-ither&rsquo;s no&rsquo; divorcin&rsquo; his wife,
      and takin&rsquo; up the space; and I hear there&rsquo;s hunders o&rsquo; pictures oot in yon
      place at Kelvin-grove.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Theatres, concerts, balls, swarees, lectures&mdash;ony mortal thing ye
      like that&rsquo;ll keep ye oot o&rsquo; your bed, ye&rsquo;ll get in Gleska if ye have the
      money to pay for&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true, Erchie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whit&rsquo;s true?&rdquo; said the old man, wrapping the paper more carefully round
      his flower-pot. &ldquo;Man, I&rsquo;m only coddin&rsquo;. Toon or country, it doesna muckle
      maitter if, like me, ye stay in yer ain hoose. I don&rsquo;t stay in Gleska; not
      me! it&rsquo;s only the place I mak&rsquo; my money in; I stay wi&rsquo; Jinnet.&rdquo;

      IX ERCHIE ON THE KING&rsquo;S CRUISE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> deliberately
      sought out Erchie one day in order to elicit his views upon the Royal
      progress through the Western Isles, and found him full of the subject,
      with the happiest disposition to eloquence thereon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man! I&rsquo;m that gled I&rsquo;m to the fore to see this prood day for Scotland,&rdquo;
       said he. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m daein&rsquo; hardly onything but read the mornin&rsquo; and evenin&rsquo; 
      papers, and if the Royal yacht comes up the length o&rsquo; Yoker I&rsquo;m gaun doon
      mysel&rsquo; to wave a hanky. &lsquo;His Majesty in Arran. Great Reception,&rsquo; says
      they. &lsquo;His Majesty in Glorious Health. Waves his hand to a Wee Lassie, and
      Nearly Shoots a Deer,&rsquo; says they. &lsquo;His Majesty&rsquo;s Yacht Surrounded by the
      Natives. Escape round the Mull. Vexation of Campbeltown, and Vote of
      Censure by the Golfers of Machrihanish,&rsquo; says they. Then the telegrams
      frae &lsquo;Oor Special Correspondent&rsquo;: &lsquo;Oban, i p.m.&mdash;It is confidently
      expected that the Royal yacht will come into the bay this evenin&rsquo; in time
      for tea. The esplanade is being washed with eau-de-Cologne, and a&rsquo; the
      magistrates is up at Rankine&rsquo;s barber shop gettin&rsquo; a dry shampoo.&rsquo; &lsquo;Oban,
      1.30 p.m.&mdash;A wire frae Colons says the Royal yacht is about to set
      sail for Oban. Tremendous excitement prevails here, and the price o&rsquo; hotel
      bedrooms is raised 200 per cent. It is decided to mobilise the local Boys&rsquo; 
      Brigade, and engage Johnny M&rsquo;Coll to play the pipes afore the King when
      he&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; ashore.&rsquo; &lsquo;6 p.m.&mdash;The Royal yacht has just passed
      Kerrara, and it is now certain that Oban will not be visited by the Royal
      party. All the flags have been taken down, and scathing comments on the
      extraordinary affair are anticipated from the local press.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe ye wadna think it, but his Majesty&rsquo;s gaun roond the West Coast for
      the sake o&rsquo; his health.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ye&rsquo;ll hae to tak&rsquo; a month o&rsquo; the rest cure,&rsquo; the doctors tellt him, &lsquo;a
      drap o&rsquo; claret wine to dinner, and nae worry aboot business.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Can I afford it?&rsquo; said his Majesty, that vexed-like, for he was puttin&rsquo; 
      aff his coat and rollin&rsquo; up his sleeves to start work for the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s nae choice in the maitter,&rsquo; said the doctors; &lsquo;we order it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But can I afford it?&rsquo; again said his Majesty. &lsquo;Ye ken yoursels, doctors,
      I have had a lot o&rsquo; expense lately, wi&rsquo; trouble in the hoose, and wi&rsquo; the
      Coronation and aething and another. Could I no&rsquo; be doin&rsquo; the noo wi&rsquo; 
      Setturday-to-Monday trips doon the watter?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But no; the doctors said there was naethin&rsquo; for him but rest. So his
      Majesty had to buy a new topcoat and a yachtin&rsquo; bunnet, and start oot on
      the <i>Victoria and Albert</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a twa-funnelled boat, but I&rsquo;m tellt that, bein&rsquo; Government built,
      yin 6&rsquo; the funnels has a blaw-doon, and they daurna light the furnace
      below&rsquo;t if the win&rsquo;s no&rsquo; in a certain airt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The yacht made first for the Isle o&rsquo; Man, and wasna five meenutes in the
      place when the great novelist, Hall Corelli or Mary Caine, or whichever it
      is, was aboard o&rsquo; her distributin&rsquo; hand-bills advertisin&rsquo; the latest
      novel, and the King took fright, and left the place as soon as he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; ye it&rsquo;s a gey sair trauchle bein&rsquo; a King. The puir sowl
      thought the Hielan&rsquo;s wad be a nice quate place where naebody wad bother
      him, and so he set sail then for Arran.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What is that I see afore me?&rsquo; said he, comin&rsquo; up past Pladda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The captain put his spy-gless to his e&rsquo;e, and got as white&rsquo;s a cloot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s your Majesty&rsquo;s joyous and expectant subjects,&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;They&rsquo;ve
      sixty-seven Gleska steamers oot yonder waitin&rsquo; on us, and every skipper
      has his hand on the string o&rsquo; the steam-hooter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;My God!&rsquo; groaned the puir King, &lsquo;I thought I was sent awa&rsquo; here for the
      guid o&rsquo; my health.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before he could say knife, a&rsquo; the Gleska steamers and ten thoosan&rsquo; wee
      rowin&rsquo;-boats were scrapin&rsquo; the pent aff the sides o&rsquo; the <i>Victoria and
      Albert</i>, and half a million Scottish taxpayers were cheerin&rsquo; their
      beloved Sovereign, Edward VII., every mortal yin o&rsquo; them sayin&rsquo;, &lsquo;Yon&rsquo;s
      him yonder!&rsquo; and p&rsquo;intin&rsquo; at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Will I hae to shoogle hands wi&rsquo; a&rsquo; that crood?&rsquo; he asked the captain o&rsquo; 
      the <i>Victoria and Albert</i>, and was told it wad dae if he jist took
      aff his kep noo and then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so, takin&rsquo; aff his kep noo and then, wi&rsquo; a&rsquo; the Gleska steamers and
      the ten thoosan&rsquo; wee rowin&rsquo;-boats hingin&rsquo; on to the side o&rsquo; the yacht, and
      half a million devoted subjects takin&rsquo; turn aboot at keekin&rsquo; in through
      the port-holes to see what he had for dinner, his Majesty sailed into
      Brodick Bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The doctors were right,&rsquo; says he; &lsquo;efter a&rsquo; there&rsquo;s naething like a rest
      cure; it&rsquo;s a mercy we&rsquo;re a&rsquo; spared.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The following day his Majesty hunted the deer in Arran. I see frae the
      papers that he was intelligently and actively assisted in this by the
      well-known ghillies, Dugald M&rsquo;Fadyen, Donald Campbell, Sandy M&rsquo;Neill, and
      Peter M&rsquo;Phedran.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They went up the hill and picked oot a nice quate he-deer, and drove it
      doon in front o&rsquo; where his Majesty sat beside a stack o&rsquo; loaded guns. His
      Majesty was graciously pleased to tak&rsquo; up yin o&rsquo; the guns, and let bang at
      the deer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Weel done! That wass gey near him,&rsquo; said Dugald M&rsquo;Fadyen, strikin&rsquo; the
      deer wi&rsquo; his stick to mak&rsquo; it stop eatin&rsquo; the gress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His Majesty fired a second time, and the deer couldna stand it ony
      langer, but went aff wi&rsquo; a breenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Weel, it&rsquo;s a fine day to be oot on the hull onywye,&rsquo; says M&rsquo;Phedran,
      resigned-like, and the things that the heid ghillie Campbell didna say was
      terrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The papers a&rsquo; said the deer was shot, and a bloody business too; but it
      wasna till lang efter the cauld-clye corpse o&rsquo;t was found on the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Here it is!&rsquo; said M&rsquo;Fadyen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I daursay it is,&rsquo; said M&rsquo;Neill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;ll hae to be it onywye,&rsquo; said the heid man, and they had it weighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it was sold in Gleska the day it would fetch ten shillin&rsquo;s a-pound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s ae thing I&rsquo;ve noticed mair nor anither aboot Hielan&rsquo; ghillies,
      it&rsquo;s that they&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; hurt your feelin&rsquo;s if they can help it. I&rsquo;m Hielan&rsquo; 
      mysel&rsquo;; my name&rsquo;s MacPherson; a flet fit but a warm hert, and I ken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meanwhile Campbeltoon washed it&rsquo;s face, put a clove in its mooth, and
      tried to look as spruce as it could for a place that has mair distilleries
      than kirks. The Royal veesit was generally regairded as providential,
      because the supremacy o&rsquo; Speyside whiskies over Campbeltoon whiskies o&rsquo; 
      recent years wad hae a chance o&rsquo; being overcome if his Majesty could be
      prevailed on to gang through a&rsquo; the distilleries and hae a sample frae
      each o&rsquo; them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was to be a gala day, and the bellman went roond the toon orderin&rsquo; 
      every loyal ceetizen to put oot a flag, cheer like onything when the King
      was gaun to the distilleries, and bide inside their hooses when he was
      comin&rsquo; back frae them. But ye&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; believ&rsquo;t&mdash;the yacht passed
      Campbeltoon!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Provost and Magistrates and the hale community was doon on the quay
      to cairry the Royal pairty shouther-high if necessary, and when they saw
      the <i>Victoria and Albert</i>&mdash;they cheered sae lood they could be
      heard the length o&rsquo; Larne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Whit&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; said his Majesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;By the smell o&rsquo;t I wad say Campbeltoon,&rsquo; said his skipper, &lsquo;and that&rsquo;s
      mair o&rsquo; your Majesty&rsquo;s subjects, awfu&rsquo; interested in your recovery.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh man!&rsquo; said the puir King, nearly greetin&rsquo;, &lsquo;we divna ken whit health
      is, ony o&rsquo; us, till we lose it. Steam as far aff frae the shore as ye can,
      and it&rsquo;ll maybe no&rsquo; be sae bad.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So the yacht ran bye Campbeltoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The folk couldna believe&rsquo;t at first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;They must hae made a mistake,&rsquo; says they; &lsquo;perhaps they didna notice the
      distillery lums,&rsquo; and the polis sergeant birled his whustle by order of
      the Provost, to ca&rsquo; the King&rsquo;s attention, but it was o&rsquo; no avail. A rale
      divert!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The yacht went on to Colonsay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the droll thing aboot this trip o&rsquo; his Majesty&rsquo;s; it&rsquo;s no&rsquo; ony
      nice, cheery sort o&rsquo; places he gangs to at a&rsquo;, but oot-o&rsquo;-the-wye wee
      places wi&rsquo; naethin&rsquo; aboot them but hills and things&mdash;wee trashy
      places wi&rsquo; nae nice braw new villas aboot them, and nae minstrels or
      banjo-singers on the esplanade singin&rsquo; &lsquo;O! Lucky Jim!&rsquo; and clautin&rsquo; on the
      bawbees. I divna suppose they had half a dizzen flags in a&rsquo; Colonsay, and
      ye wad fancy the King&rsquo;s een&rsquo;s no&rsquo; that sair lookin&rsquo; at flags but whit he
      wad be pleased to see mair o&rsquo; them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonsay! Man, it&rsquo;s fair peetifu&rsquo;! No&rsquo; a Provost or a Bylie in&rsquo;t to hear
      a bit speech frae; nae steamboat trips to gang roond the Royal yacht and
      keek in the port-holes; but everything as quate as a kirk on a Setturday
      mornin&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A&rsquo; the rest o&rsquo; Scotland wanted to wag flags at his Majesty Edward VII.,
      and here he maun put up at Colonsay! The thing was awfu&rsquo; badly managed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Campbeltoon was chawed at the yacht passin&rsquo; withoot giein&rsquo; a cry in,
      whit&rsquo;s to describe the vexation o&rsquo; Oban?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oban had its hert set on&rsquo;t. It never occurred to the mind o&rsquo; Oban for wan
      meenute that the King could pass the &lsquo;Charin&rsquo; Cross o&rsquo; the Hielan&rsquo;s&rsquo; 
      withoot spendin&rsquo; a week there at the very least, and everything was
      arranged to mak&rsquo; the Royal convalescent comfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bay was fair jammed wi&rsquo; yachts, and a&rsquo; the steam-whustles were oiled.
      The hotels were packed to the roof wi&rsquo; English tourists, some o&rsquo; them
      sleepin&rsquo; under the slates, wi&rsquo; their feet in the cisterns, and gled to pay
      gey dear for the preevilege o&rsquo; breathin&rsquo; the same air as Edward VII.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Early in the day somebody sent the alarmin&rsquo; tidin&rsquo;s frae Colonsay that
      the <i>Victoria and Albert</i> micht pass Oban efter a&rsquo;, and to prevent
      this, herrin&rsquo;-nets were stretched aff Kerrara to catch her if ony such
      dastardly move was made.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it was nae use; Oban&rsquo;s in sackcloth and ashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Where are we noo?&rsquo; asked the Royal voyager, aff Kerrara. &lsquo;Is this
      Shingleton-on-the-Sea?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No, your Majesty,&rsquo; says the skipper of the Royal yacht, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s Oban, the
      place whaur the German waiters get their education.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Heavens!&rsquo; cried his Majesty, shudderin&rsquo;; &lsquo;we&rsquo;re terrible close; put a
      fire under the aft funnel at a&rsquo; costs and get past as quick as we can.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was pointed oot to his Majesty that the toon was evidently expectin&rsquo; 
      him, and so, to mak&rsquo; things pleasant, he ordered the steam pinnace to land
      the week&rsquo;s washin&rsquo; at the Charin&rsquo;. Cross o&rsquo; the Hielan&rsquo;s&mdash;while the
      <i>Victoria and Albert</i> went on her way to Ballachulish.&rdquo;

      X HOW JINNET SAW THE KING
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> saw him and her
      on Thursday,&rdquo; said Erchie, &ldquo;as nate&rsquo;s ye like, and it didna cost me mair
      nor havin&rsquo; my hair cut. They gaed past oor kirk, and the session put up a
      stand, and chairges ten shillin&rsquo;s a sate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Not for Joe,&rsquo; says I; &lsquo;I&rsquo;d sooner buy mysel&rsquo; a new pair o&rsquo; boots;&rsquo; and I
      went to Duffy and says I, &lsquo;Duffy, are ye no&rsquo; gaun to hae oot yer bonny wee
      lorry at the heid o&rsquo; Gairbraid Street and ask the wife and Jinnet and me
      to stand on&rsquo;t?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Right,&rsquo; says Duffy, &lsquo;bring you Jinnet and I&rsquo;ll tak&rsquo; my wife, and we&rsquo;ll
      hae a rale pant.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So there was the four o&rsquo; us standin&rsquo; five mortal &lsquo;oors on Duffy&rsquo;s
      coal-lorry. I was that gled when it was a&rsquo; bye. But I&rsquo;ll wager there was
      naebody gledder nor the King himsel&rsquo;, puir sowl! Frae the time he cam&rsquo; 
      into Gleska at Queen Street Station till the time he left Maryhill, he
      lifted his hat three million seven hundred and sixty-eight thousand and
      sixty-three times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talk aboot it bein&rsquo; a fine job bein&rsquo; a King! I can tell ye the money&rsquo;s
      gey hard earned. Afore he starts oot to see his beloved people, he has to
      practise for a week wi&rsquo; the dumb-bells, and feed himsel&rsquo; up on Force,
      Grape-nuts, Plasmon, Pianolio, and a&rsquo; thae strengthenin&rsquo; diets that Sunny
      Jim eats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thocht first Jinnet maybe wadna gang, her bein&rsquo; in the Co-operative
      Store and no&rsquo; awfu&rsquo; ta&rsquo;en up wi&rsquo; Royalty, but, dod! she jumped at the
      chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The Queen&rsquo;s a rale nice buddy,&rsquo; she says; &lsquo;no that I&rsquo;m personally
      acquainted wi&rsquo; her, but I hear them sayin&rsquo;. And she used to mak&rsquo; a&rsquo; her
      ain claes afore she mairried the King.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So Jinnet and me were oot on Duffy&rsquo;s lorry, sittin&rsquo; on auld copies o&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;Reynolds&rsquo;s News,&rsquo; and hurrayin&rsquo; awa&rsquo; like a pair o&rsquo; young yins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first thing Jinnet saw was a woman wi&rsquo; a wean and it&rsquo;s face no&rsquo; richt
      washed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Fancy her bringin&rsquo; oot her wean to see the King, wi&rsquo; a face like that,&rsquo; 
      says Jinnet, and gies the puir wee smout a sweetie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frae that till it was time for us to gang hame Jinnet saw naething but
      weans, and her and Duffy&rsquo;s wife talked aboot weans even on. Ye wad think
      it was a baby-show we were at and no&rsquo; a King&rsquo;s procession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Duffy sat wi&rsquo; a Tontine face on him maist o&rsquo; the time, but every noo and
      then gaun up the street at the back o&rsquo; us to buy himsel&rsquo; a bottle o&rsquo; broon
      robin, for he couldna get near a pub; and I sat tryin&rsquo; as hard&rsquo;s I could
      to think hoo I wad like to be a King, and what kind o&rsquo; waistcoats I wad
      wear if I had the job. On every hand the flags were wavin&rsquo;, and the folk
      were eatin&rsquo; Abernaithy biscuits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At aboot twelve o&rsquo;clock cannons begood to bang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh my! I hope there&rsquo;s nae weans near thae cannons or they micht get
      hurt,&rsquo; says Jinnet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little did she think that at that parteecular meenute the King was comin&rsquo; 
      doon the tunnel frae Cowlairs, and tellin&rsquo; her Majesty no&rsquo; to be frichted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the King set foot in the Queen Street Station he gied the wan look
      roond him, and says he, &lsquo;Is this Gleska can ony o&rsquo; ye tell me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It is that, wi&rsquo; your Majesty&rsquo;s gracious permission,&rsquo; says the porter;
      &lsquo;sees a haud o&rsquo; yer bag.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I mind fine o&rsquo; bein&rsquo; here yince afore,&rsquo; says the King, and gangs oot
      into George Square.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Whitna graveyaird&rsquo;s this?&rsquo; he asks, lookin&rsquo; at the statues.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s no&rsquo; a graveyaird; it&rsquo;s a square, and that&rsquo;s the Municeepal
      Buildin&rsquo;,&rsquo; somebody tells him. His Majesty then laid a foundation-stone as
      smert&rsquo;s ye like wi&rsquo; his least wee bit touch, and then went into the
      Municeepal Buildin&rsquo;s and had a snack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He cam&rsquo; oot feelin&rsquo; fine. &lsquo;The Second City o&rsquo; the Empire!&rsquo; he says. &lsquo;I
      can weel believ&rsquo;t. If it wasna for my business bein&rsquo; in London I wad hae a
      hoose here. Whit am I to dae next?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They took his Majesty doon Buchanan Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No bad!&rsquo; says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he cam&rsquo; to Argyle Street, and gaed west, past the Hielan&rsquo;man&rsquo;s Cross
      at the heid o&rsquo; Jamaica Street. He sees a lot o&rsquo; chaps there wi&rsquo; the
      heather stickin&rsquo; oot o&rsquo; their ears, and a tartan brogue that thick it
      nearly spiled the procession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The Hielan&rsquo;man&rsquo;s Cross,&rsquo; says he; &lsquo;man, ay! I&rsquo;ve heard o&rsquo;t.
      Kamerhashendoo. If I had thocht o&rsquo;t I wad hae brocht my kilts and my
      pibroch and a&rsquo; that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A&rsquo; the wey doon the Dumbarton Road the folk were fair hingin&rsquo; oot o&rsquo; 
      their windows, wavin&rsquo; onything at a&rsquo; they could get a haud o&rsquo;, and the
      Royal carriage was bump-bump-bumpin&rsquo; like a&rsquo; that ower the granite setts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Whit&rsquo;s wrang wi&rsquo; the streets o&rsquo; Gleska?&rsquo; says the King, him bein&rsquo; used
      to wud streets in London, whaur he works.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s granite, if ye please,&rsquo; says they.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh ay!&rsquo; says the King; &lsquo;man, it mak&rsquo;s a fine noise. Will we soon be
      there? I&rsquo; like this fine, but I wadna like to keep onybody waitin&rsquo;.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Finnieston the folk cam&rsquo; up frae the side streets and fair grat wi&rsquo; 
      patriotic fervour. For-bye, a&rsquo; the pubs were shut for an&rsquo;oor or twa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Whit I want to see&rsquo;s the poor,&rsquo; says the King. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m tired lookin&rsquo; at the
      folk that&rsquo;s weel aff; they&rsquo;re faur ower common.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Them&rsquo;s the poor,&rsquo; he was tellt; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s the best we can dae for your
      Majesty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But they&rsquo;re awfu&rsquo; bien-lookin&rsquo; and weel put on,&rsquo; says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh ay!&rsquo; they tells him, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s their Sunday claes.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so the Royal procession passed on its way, the King being supplied
      wi&rsquo; a new hat every, ten minutes, to mak&rsquo; up for the yins he spiled
      liftin&rsquo; them to his frantic and patriotic subjects.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In ten to fifteen minutes he examined the pictures in the Art Galleries&mdash;the
      Dutch, the English, the Italian, and the Gleska schools o&rsquo; painters; the
      stuffed birds, and the sugaraully hats the polis used to hae when you and
      me was jinkin&rsquo; them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Och, it&rsquo;s fine,&rsquo; says he; &lsquo;there&rsquo;s naething wrang wi&rsquo; the place. Are we
      no&rsquo; near Maryhill noo?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye see his Majesty had on a bate he could see the hale o&rsquo; Gleska in five
      &lsquo;oors or less, an&rsquo; be oot sooner nor ony ither king that ever set a fit in
      it. They wanted him to mak&rsquo; a circular tour o&rsquo;t, and come back to the
      Municeepal Buildin&rsquo;s for his tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Catch me,&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m gaun back to Dalkeith.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A&rsquo; this time we were standin&rsquo; on Duffy&rsquo;s lorry, flanked on the left by
      the Boy&rsquo;s Brigade, lookin&rsquo; awfu&rsquo; fierce, and the riflemen frae Dunoon on
      the richt. Every noo an&rsquo; then a sodger went bye on a horse, or a lassie
      nearly fainted and had to be led alang the line by a polisman, and him no&rsquo; 
      awfu&rsquo; carin&rsquo; for the job. Duffy was gaun up the street to buy broon robin
      that aften he was gettin&rsquo; sunburnt, and my wife Jinnet nearly hurt her een
      lookin&rsquo; for weans.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Look at thon wee wean, Erchie,&rsquo; she wad aye be tellin&rsquo; me, &lsquo;does&rsquo;t no&rsquo; 
      put ye in mind o&rsquo; Rubbert&rsquo;s wee Hughie? Oh, the cratur!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Wumman,&rsquo; I tellt her, &lsquo;this is no&rsquo; a kinderspiel ye&rsquo;re at; it&rsquo;s a Royal
      procession. I wonder to me ye wad be wastin&rsquo; yer e&rsquo;esicht lookin&rsquo; at weans
      when there&rsquo;s sae mony braw sodgers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, Erchie!&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m bye wi&rsquo; the sodgers;&rsquo; and jist wi&rsquo; that the
      procession cam&rsquo; up the street. First the Lancers wi&rsquo; their dickies
      stickin&rsquo; ootside their waistcoats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Man, them&rsquo;s fine horses,&rsquo; says Duffy, wi&rsquo; a professional eye on the
      beasts. &lsquo;Chaps me that broon yin wi&rsquo; the white feet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then cam&rsquo; the King and Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Whaur&rsquo;s their croons?&rsquo; asks Duffy&rsquo;s wife. &lsquo;I divna believe that&rsquo;s them
      at a&rsquo;.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s them, I&rsquo;ll bate ony money,&rsquo; I says. &lsquo;Ye can tell by the hurry
      they&rsquo;re in.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, the craturs!&rsquo; says Jinnet, and then says she, &lsquo;Oh, Erchie! look at
      the wean hanging ower that window. I&rsquo;m feart it&rsquo;ll fa&rsquo; ower.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afore she could get her een aff the wean the King&rsquo;s cairrage was past,
      and the rest o&rsquo; the Lancers cam&rsquo; clatterin&rsquo; after them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Noo for the brass bands!&rsquo; says Duffy, lookin&rsquo; doon the street. But there
      was nae brass bands. The show was bye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;If I had kent that was to be a&rsquo; that was in&rsquo;t, I wad never hae ta&rsquo;en oot
      my lorry,&rsquo; says Duffy, as angry as onything, and made a breenge for
      anither bottle o&rsquo; broon robin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Och, it was fine,&rsquo; says Jinnet. &lsquo;I never saw sae mony weans in a&rsquo; my
      days.&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the crood began to scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His Majesty reached Maryhill Station exact to the minute, wi&rsquo; his eye on
      his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Weel, that&rsquo;s bye ony wye,&rsquo; says he, and somebody cries for a speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;People o&rsquo; Gleska,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;I have seen your toon. It&rsquo;s fine&mdash;there&rsquo;s
      naething wrang wi&rsquo;t,&rsquo; and then the gaird blew his whustle, and the train
      went aff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The great event was ower, the rain begood to fa&rsquo; again; the Gilmorehill
      student hurried hame to blacken his face and put on his sister&rsquo;s frock.
      The coloured ping-pong balls strung ower Sauchieha&rsquo; Street was lighted,
      the illuminated skoosh cars began to skoosh up and doon the street, the
      public-hooses did a fine tred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m gled it&rsquo;s a&rsquo; bye,&rsquo; says Jinnet, when we got hame to oor ain hoose.

      &ldquo;&lsquo;Indeed, and so am I,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;There wad be fine fun in this warld a&rsquo;

      XI ERCHIE RETURNS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>or weeks I had not
      seen Erchie. He was not to be met on the accustomed streets, and St
      Kentigern&rsquo;s Kirk having been closed since July for alterations and
      repairs, it was useless to go there in search of its beadle. Once I met
      Duffy, and asked him what had become of the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alloo you Erchie!&rdquo; was all the information he would vouchsafe; &ldquo;if he&rsquo;s
      keepin&rsquo; oot o&rsquo; sicht, he&rsquo;ll hae his ain reason for&rsquo;t. Mind, I&rsquo;m no&rsquo; sayin&rsquo; 
      onything against the cratur, though him and me&rsquo;s had mony a row. He&rsquo;s a&rsquo; 
      richt if ye tak&rsquo; him the richt wye. But sly! He&rsquo;s that sly, the auld yin,
      ye can whiles see him winkin&rsquo; awa&rsquo; to himsel&rsquo; ower something he kens that
      naebody else kens, and that he&rsquo;s no gaun to tell to them. I havena seen
      the auld fuiter since the Fair week; perhaps he&rsquo;s gotten genteel and
      bidin&rsquo; doon at Rothesay till the summer steamboats stop. There&rsquo;s yin thing
      sure&mdash;it&rsquo;s no&rsquo; a case o&rsquo; wife-desertion, for Jinnet&rsquo;s wi&rsquo; him. I can
      tell by the Venetian blinds and the handle o&rsquo; their door. Sly! Did ye say
      sly? Man, it&rsquo;s no&rsquo; the word for&rsquo;t. Erchie MacPherson&rsquo;s fair lost at the
      waitin&rsquo;; he should hae been a poet, or a statesman, or something in the
      fancy line like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was with the joy of a man who has made up his mind he has lost a
      sovereign and finds it weeks after in the lining of his waistcoat, I
      unexpectedly met Erchie on Saturday.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, old friend,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I thought you were dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nor deid!&rdquo; retorted Erchie. &ldquo;Catch me! I&rsquo;m nane o&rsquo; the deein&rsquo; kind.
      But I micht nearly as weel be deid, for I&rsquo;ve been thae twa months in
      Edinburgh. Yon&rsquo;s the place for a man in a decline; it&rsquo;s that slow he wad
      hae a chance o&rsquo; livin&rsquo; to a grand auld age. There&rsquo;s mair o&rsquo; a bustle on
      the road to Sichthill Cemetery ony day in the week than there is in
      Princes Street on a Setter-day nicht. I had a bit job there for the last
      ten weeks, and the only pleesure I had was gaun doon noo and then to the
      Waverley Station to see the bonny wee trains frae Gleska. They&rsquo;re a&rsquo; richt
      for scenery and the like o&rsquo; that in Edinburgh, but they&rsquo;re no&rsquo; smert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s an old saying, Erchie, that all the wise men in Glasgow come
      from the East&mdash;that&rsquo;s to say, they come from Edinburgh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and the wiser they are the quicker they come,&rdquo; said Erchie. &ldquo;Man!
      and it&rsquo;s only an &lsquo;oor&rsquo;s journey, and to see the wye some o&rsquo; them gae on
      bidin&rsquo; ower yonder ye wad think they had the Atlantic Ocean to cross.
      There should be missionaries sent ower to Edinburgh explainin&rsquo; things to
      the puir deluded craturs. Ony folk that wad put thon big humplock o&rsquo; a
      hill they ca&rsquo; the Castle in the middle o&rsquo; the street, spilin&rsquo; the view,
      and hing their washin&rsquo;s on hay-rakes stuck oot at their windows, hae
      muckle to learn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, I have no doubt Edinburgh&rsquo;s doing its best, Erchie,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe, but they&rsquo;re no&rsquo; smert; ye wad hae yer pouch picked half a dizzen
      times in Gleska in the time an Edinburgh polisman tak&rsquo;s to rub his een to
      waken himsel&rsquo; when ye ask him the road to Leith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did ye ever hear tell o&rsquo; the Edinburgh man that ance ventured to Gleska
      and saw the hopper dredgers clawtin&rsquo; up the glaur frae the Clyde at
      Broomielaw?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Whit are ye standin&rsquo; here for? Come awa&rsquo; and hae a gless o&rsquo; milk,&rsquo; said
      a freen&rsquo; to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No, nor awa&rsquo;,&rsquo; said he, glowerin&rsquo; like ony-thing; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve coonted 364 o&rsquo; 
      thae wee buckets comin&rsquo; oot the watter, and I&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; move a step oot o&rsquo; 
      here till I see the last o&rsquo; them!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The puir cratur never saw a rale river in his life afore. Och! but
      Edinburgh&rsquo;s no&rsquo; that bad; ye can aye be sure o&rsquo; gettin&rsquo; yer nicht&rsquo;s sleep
      in&rsquo;t at ony&rsquo;oor o&rsquo; the day, it&rsquo;s that quate. They&rsquo;re aye braggin&rsquo; that
      it&rsquo;s cleaner than Gleska, as if there was onything smert aboot that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s naething dirtier nor a dirty Gleska man,&rsquo; said yin o&rsquo; them to me
      ae day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;There is,&rsquo; says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Whit?&rsquo; says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Twa clean Edinburgh yins,&rsquo; says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Och! but I&rsquo;m only in fun. Edinburgh&rsquo;s a&rsquo; richt; there&rsquo;s naething wrang
      wi&rsquo; the place ance ye&rsquo;re in it if ye hae a book to read. I hate to hear
      the wye Duffy and some o&rsquo; them speak aboot Edinburgh, the same as if it
      was shut up a&rsquo;thegither; hoo wad we like it oorsels? I hae maybe a flet
      fit, but I hae a warm hert, and I&rsquo;ll aye stick up for Edinburgh. I had an
      uncle that near got the jyle there for running ower yin o&rsquo; their tramway
      caurs. They&rsquo;ve no skoosh cars in Edinburgh; they&rsquo;re thon ither kin&rsquo; that&rsquo;s
      pu&rsquo;ed wi&rsquo; a rope, and whiles the rope breaks; but it doesna maitter,
      naebody&rsquo;s in ony hurry gaun to ony place in Edinburgh, and the passengers
      jist sit where they are till it&rsquo;s mended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, anyhow, Erchie, we&rsquo;re glad to see you back,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gled to see me back!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager ye didna ken I was awa&rsquo;, and
      the only folk that kent we werena in Gleska for the past twa or three
      months was the dairy and the wee shop we get oor vegetables frae.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I was in Edinburgh yonder, skliffin&rsquo; alang the streets as fast&rsquo;s I
      could, and nippin&rsquo; mysel&rsquo; every noo and them to keep mysel&rsquo; frae fa&rsquo;in&rsquo; 
      asleep, I wad be thinkin&rsquo; to mysel&rsquo;, &lsquo;Hoo are they gettin&rsquo; on in Gleska
      wantin&rsquo; Erchie MacPherson? Noo that they&rsquo;ve lost me, they&rsquo;ll ken the worth
      o&rsquo; me.&rsquo; I made shair that, at least, the skoosh cars wad hae to stop
      runnin&rsquo; when I was awa&rsquo;, and that the polis band wad come doon to the
      station to meet me when I cam&rsquo; hame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dod! ye wad hardly believe it, but ever since I cam&rsquo; back I meet naebody
      but folk that never ken&rsquo;t I was awa&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s a gey hertless place Gleska
      that way. Noo, in Edinburgh it&rsquo;s different. They&rsquo;re gey sweart to lose ye
      in Edinburgh ance they get haud o&rsquo; ye; that&rsquo;s the way they keep up the
      price o&rsquo; the railway ticket to Gleska.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was tellin&rsquo; Duffy aboot Edinburgh, and he&rsquo;s gaun through wi&rsquo; a trip to
      see&rsquo;t on Monday. It&rsquo;ll be a puir holiday for the cratur, but let him jist
      tak&rsquo; it. He&rsquo;ll be better there than wastin&rsquo; his money in a toon. When
      Duffy goes onywhere on ony o&rsquo; the Gleska holidays, it&rsquo;s generally to
      Airdrie, or Coatbrig, or Clydebank he goes, and walks aboot the streets
      till the polis put him on the last train hame for Gleska, and him singin&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;Dark Lochnagar&rsquo; wi&rsquo; the tears in his een.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll say to me next mornin&rsquo;, &lsquo;Man! Erchie, thon&rsquo;s a thrivin&rsquo; place,
      Coatbrig, but awfu&rsquo; bad whisky.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot like him aboot a Gleska holiday. They&rsquo;ll be gettin&rsquo; up to a
      late breakfast wi&rsquo; no parridge till&rsquo;t on Monday mornin&rsquo;, and sayin&rsquo;, &lsquo;Man!
      it&rsquo;s a grand day for Dunoon,&rsquo; and then start druggin&rsquo; themsel&rsquo;s wi&rsquo; drams.
      Ye wad think they were gaun to get twa teeth ta&rsquo;en oot instead o&rsquo; gaun on
      a holiday.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s no&rsquo; my notion o&rsquo; a holiday, either in the Autumn or the Spring.
      I&rsquo;m takin&rsquo; Jinnet oot on Monday to Milliken Park to see her kizzen that
      keeps a gairden. We&rsquo;ll hae an awfu&rsquo; wrastle in the mornin&rsquo; catchin&rsquo; the
      train, and it&rsquo;ll be that crooded we&rsquo;ll hae to stand a&rsquo; the way. The wife&rsquo;s
      kizzen&rsquo;ll be that gled to see us she&rsquo;ll mak&rsquo; tea for us every half-&rsquo;oor
      and send oot each time to the grocer&rsquo;s for mair o&rsquo; thon biled ham ye aye
      get at burials. I&rsquo;ll get my feet a&rsquo; sair walkin&rsquo; up and doon the gairden
      coontin&rsquo; the wife&rsquo;s kizzen&rsquo;s aipples that&rsquo;s no&rsquo; richt ripe yet, and Jinnet
      and me&rsquo;ll hae to cairry hame a big poke o&rsquo; rhuburb or greens, or some
      ither stuff we&rsquo;re no wantin&rsquo;, and the train&rsquo;ll be an &lsquo;oor late o&rsquo; gettin&rsquo; 
      into Gleska.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a holiday. The only time ye enjoy a holiday is when it&rsquo;s a&rsquo; bye.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XII DUFFY&rsquo;S FIRST FAMILY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>ore than a year
      after the King&rsquo;s visit Erchie and I one day passed, a piano-organ in the
      street playing &ldquo;Dark Lochnagar.&rdquo; The air attracted him; he hummed it very
      much out of tune for some minutes after.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do ye hear that?&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;&lsquo;Dark Lochnagar&rsquo;; I used ance to could nearly
      play&rsquo;t on the mooth harmonium. I learned it aff Duffy. Him and me was
      mairried aboot the same time. We lived in the same close up in the
      Coocaddens&mdash;him on the top flet, and Jinnet and me in the flet below.
      Oor wifes had turn aboot o&rsquo; the same credle&mdash;and it was kept gey
      throng, I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; ye. If it wasna Duffy up the stair at nicht, efter his
      wark was done, rockin&rsquo; awa&rsquo; wi&rsquo; a grudge&rsquo;ter the tune o&rsquo; &lsquo;Dark Lochnagar,&rsquo; 
      it was me below at no&rsquo; &lsquo;Auld Lang Syne,&rsquo; but yon ither yin ye ken fine. I
      daresay it was rockin&rsquo; the credle helped to mak&rsquo; my feet flet, and it
      micht hae happened in a far waur cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Duffy&rsquo;s first wife; she dee&rsquo;d, I think, to get rid o&rsquo; him&mdash;the
      cratur! Duffy&rsquo;s yin o&rsquo; thae men wi&rsquo; a great big lump o&rsquo; a hert that brocht
      the tear to his ain een when he was singin&rsquo; &lsquo;Bonny Annie Laurie&rsquo; doon in
      the Mull o&rsquo; Kintyre Vaults, but wad see his wife to bleezes afore he wad
      brush his ain boots for Sunday, and her no&rsquo; weel. She fair adored him,
      too. She thocht Duffy was jist the ordinar&rsquo; kind o&rsquo; man, and that I was a
      kind o&rsquo; eccentric peely-wally sowl, because I sometimes dried the dishes,
      and didna noo an&rsquo; then gie Jinnet a beltin&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;His looks is the best o&rsquo; him,&rsquo; she wad tell Jinnet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Then he&rsquo;s gey hard up!&rsquo; I wad say to Jinnet when she tellt me this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s no&rsquo; very strong,&rsquo;&mdash;that was aye her cry, when she was fryin&rsquo; 
      anither pun&rsquo; o&rsquo; ham and a pair o&rsquo; kippers for his breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Duffy&rsquo;s first wean was Wullie John. Ye wad think, to hear Duffy brag
      abobt him, that it was a new patent kind o&rsquo; wean, and there wasna anither
      in Coocaddens, whaur, I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; ye, weans is that rife ye hae to walk to
      yer work skliffin&rsquo; yer feet in case ye tramp on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Duffy&rsquo;s notion was to rear a race o&rsquo; kind o&rsquo; gladiators, and he rubbed
      him a&rsquo; ower every nicht wi&rsquo; olive-oil to mak&rsquo; him soople. Nane o&rsquo; your
      fancy foods for weans for Wullie John. It was rale auld Caledonia&mdash;parridge
      and soor dook, that soor the puir wee smout went aboot grewin&rsquo; wi&rsquo; its
      mooth a&rsquo; slewed to the side, as if it was practising the wye the women
      haud their hairpins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mony a time I&rsquo;ve seen oor Jinnet sneak him into oor hoose to gie him
      curds-and-cream; he said he liked them fine, because they were sae slippy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Show your temper, Wullie John,&rsquo; Duffy wad tell him when onybody was in
      the hoose; and the wee cratur was trained at that to put on a fearfu&rsquo; face
      and haud up his claws.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;See that!&rsquo; Duffy wad say as prood as ony-thing; &lsquo;the game&rsquo;s there, I&rsquo;m
      tellin&rsquo; ye.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Duffy began to harden him. He wad haud him up by the lug to see if
      he was game, and if he grat that was coonted wan to Duffy, and Wullie John
      got nae jeely on his piece. He was washed every mornin&rsquo;, winter and
      summer, in cauld watter in the jaw-box, and rubbed wi&rsquo; a tooel as coorse
      as a carrot-grater till the skin was peelin&rsquo; aff his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ye need to bring oot the glow,&rsquo; Duffy wad say to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;If it gangs on much further,&rsquo; I tellt him, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll bring oot the polis.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wullie John was fair on the road for bein&rsquo; an A1 gladiator, but he went
      and dee&rsquo;d on Duffy, and I never saw a man mair chawed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Duffy&rsquo;s next was a laddie too&mdash;they ca&rsquo;d him Alexander. There was
      gaun to be nane o&rsquo; their hardenin&rsquo; dydoes wi&rsquo; Alexander.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was aboot the time Duffy took to politics, and said the thing the
      Democratic pairty wanted was educated men wi&rsquo; brains. He made up his mind
      that Alexander wad never cairry a coal-poke, but get the best o&rsquo; learnin&rsquo; 
      if it cost a pound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wasna very strong, was Alexander, and Duffy fed him maist o&rsquo; the time
      on Gregory&rsquo;s mixture, cod-ile, and ony ither stuff he could buy by word o&rsquo; 
      mooth at the apothecary&rsquo;s withoot a doctor&rsquo;s line. Alexander was getting
      medicine poored into him that often he was feared to gant in case he wad
      jar his teeth on a table-spoon when his een was shut. He wore hot-water
      bottles to his feet in the deid o&rsquo; summer, and if he had a sair heid in
      the mornin&rsquo; afore he started for the school on the geography days he was
      put to his bed and fed on tapioca. Everything went wrang wi&rsquo; puir wee
      Alexander. The hives went in wi&rsquo; him, and the dregs o&rsquo; the measles cam&rsquo; 
      oot. He took every trouble that was gaun aboot except gymnastics; Duffy
      took him to Professor Coats, the bump-man, and had his heid examined; the
      Professor said it was as fine a heid o&rsquo; its kind as ever he saw, and Duffy
      put a bawbee on the bag o&rsquo; coals richt aff, and began to put the money bye
      for Alexander&rsquo;s college fees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alexander&rsquo;s a man nod, and daein&rsquo; fine. He&rsquo;s in the gas office; the only
      time he went to college was to read the meter there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye canna tell whit laddies&rsquo;ll turn oot, and it&rsquo;s no&rsquo; ony better wi&rsquo; 
      lassies. Duffy had a wheen o&rsquo; lassies; I forget hoo mony there was
      a&rsquo;thegither, but when they were coortin&rsquo; ye wad think ye were gaim doon
      the middle o&rsquo; the Haymakers&rsquo; country dance when ye cam&rsquo; up the close at
      nicht.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The auldest&mdash;she was Annie&mdash;was naething particular fancy; she
      jist nursed the rest, and made their peenies, and washed for them, and
      trimmed her ain hats, and made Duffy&rsquo;s auld waistcoats into suits for the
      wee yins, and never got to the dancin&rsquo;, so naebody merried her, and she&rsquo;s
      there yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A&rsquo; the chaps cam&rsquo; efter her sisters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sisters never let on aboot the coal-ree and Duffy&rsquo;s lorry, but said
      their paw was in the coal tred&mdash;a kind o&rsquo; a coal-maister. It was a
      bonny sicht to see them merchin&rsquo; oot to their cookery lessons in the
      efternoons, their hair as curly&rsquo;s onything, and their beds no&rsquo; made.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The days they tried new dishes frae the cookery lessons at hame, Duffy
      took his meat in the Western Cookin&rsquo; Depot, and cam&rsquo; hame when it was
      dark. Yin o&rsquo; them played the mandoline. The mandoline&rsquo;s a noble
      instrument; it cheers the workman&rsquo;s hame; a lassie gaun alang the street
      wi&rsquo; a nice print dress, and a case wi&rsquo; a mandoline&rsquo;, is jist the sort I
      wad fancy mysel&rsquo; if I was a young yin and there wasna Jinnet. A fruiterer
      merried the mandoline. The nicht she was merrit, Duffy sang &lsquo;Dark
      Lochnagar,&rsquo; and winked at me like a&rsquo; that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Learn your dochters the mandoline, Erchie,&rsquo; says he in my lug, &lsquo;and
      they&rsquo;ll gang aff your haunds like snaw aff a dyke. That&rsquo;s the advice I wad
      gie ye if ye had ony dochters left. I wad hae made it the piano, but we
      couldna get a piano up past the bend on the stair.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Efter the mandoline went, the boys begood to scramble for Duffy&rsquo;s
      dochters as if they were bowl-money. The close-mooth was never clear o&rsquo; 
      cabs, and the rice was always up to your ankles on the stair. Duffy sang
      &lsquo;Dark Lochnagar&rsquo; even-on, and aye kept winkin&rsquo; at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s the mandoline awa&rsquo;,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;and the scientific dressmakin&rsquo;,
      and the shorthand, and the &ldquo;Curfew must hot Ring To-night,&rdquo; and the
      revival meetin&rsquo;s, and the no&rsquo; very-weel yin that needs a nice quate hame;
      they&rsquo;re a&rsquo; gane, Erchie, and I&rsquo;m no&rsquo; gien jeely-dishes awa&rsquo; wi&rsquo; them
      either. I&rsquo;m my lee-lane, me and Annie; if ony o&rsquo; thae chaps cam&rsquo; efter
      Annie, I wad chase him doon the stair.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Man! Duffy,&rsquo; I says till him, &lsquo;ye&rsquo;re selfish enough workin&rsquo; aff a&rsquo; them
      ornamental dochters on the young men o&rsquo; Gleska that did ye nae hairm, and
      keepin&rsquo; the best o&rsquo; the hale jing-bang in the hoose a&rsquo; the time in case
      they see her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Let them tak&rsquo; it!&rsquo; says Duffy, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m no&rsquo; a bit vexed for them,&rsquo; and he
      started to sing &lsquo;Dark Lochnagar&rsquo; as lood as ever, while Annie was puttin&rsquo; 
      on his boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was in Duffy&rsquo;s auld days. He merried a second wife, and it was a
      fair tak&rsquo;-in, for he thocht a wee greengrocer&rsquo;s shop she had was her ain,
      and a&rsquo; the time it was her brither&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s the mandoline for you, Duffy,&rsquo; says I, when he tellt me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that yin died on him too; she died last Mertinmas; Duffy&rsquo;s kind o&rsquo; 
      oot o&rsquo; wifes the noo. And the warst o&rsquo;t is that his dochter Annie&rsquo;s
      gettin&rsquo; merried.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XIII ERCHIE GOES TO A BAZAAR
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>here was a very
      self-conscious look in Erchie&rsquo;s face on Saturday when I met him with a
      hand-painted drain-pipe of the most generous proportions under his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s aye the way,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Did ye ever hae ony o&rsquo; yer parteecular
      freen&rsquo;s meet ye when ye were takin&rsquo; hame a brace o&rsquo; grouse? No&rsquo; a bit o&rsquo; 
      ye! But if it&rsquo;s a poke o&rsquo; onything, or a parcel frae the country, whaur
      they havena ony broon paper, but jist &lsquo;The Weekly Mail,&rsquo; and nae richt
      twine, ye&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; can gang the length o&rsquo; the street without comin&rsquo; across
      everybody that gangs to yer kirk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put the drain-pipe down on the pavement&mdash;it was the evening&mdash;and
      sat on the end of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you are the latest victim to the art movement, Erchie?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You
      will be putting away your haircloth chairs and introducing the sticky
      plush variety; I was suspicious of that new dado in your parlour the day
      we had the tousy tea after Big Macphee&rsquo;s burial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Catch me!&rdquo; said Erchie. &ldquo;Them and their art! I wadna be encouragin&rsquo; the
      deevils. If ye want to ken the way I&rsquo;m gaun hame wi&rsquo; this wally
      umbrella-staun&rsquo;, I&rsquo;ll tell ye the rale truth. It&rsquo;s jist this, that.
      Jinnet&rsquo;s doon yonder at the Freemason&rsquo;s Bazaar wi&rsquo; red-hot money in her
      pooch, and canna get awa&rsquo; till it&rsquo;s done. She&rsquo;s bocht a tea-cosy besides
      this drain-pipe, and a toaster wi&rsquo; puce ribbons on&rsquo;t for haudin&rsquo; letters
      and papers, and she&rsquo;ll be in luck for yince if she disna win the raffle
      for the lady&rsquo;s bicycle that she had twa tickets for. Fancy me oot in Grove
      Street in the early mornin&rsquo; learnin&rsquo; Jinnet the bicycle, and her the
      granny o&rsquo; seeven!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, Jinnet&rsquo;s no&rsquo; needin&rsquo; ony bicycle ony mair than she&rsquo;s needin&rsquo; a
      bassinette, but she has a saft hert and canna say no unless she&rsquo;s awfu&rsquo; 
      angry, and a young chap, speakin&rsquo; awfu&rsquo; Englified, wi&rsquo; his hair a&rsquo; 
      vasaline, got roond her. She&rsquo;s waitin&rsquo; behin&rsquo; there to see if she wins the
      raffle, and to pick up ony bargains jist a wee while afore the place shuts
      up&mdash;the rale time for bazaar bargains if ye divna get yer leg broken
      in the crush. I only went there mysel&rsquo; to see if I could get her to come
      hame as lang as she had enough left to pay her fare on the skoosh car, but
      I micht as weel speak to the wind. She was fair raised ower a bargain in
      rabbits. It&rsquo;s an awfu&rsquo; thing when yer wife tak&rsquo;s to bazaars; it&rsquo;s waur nor
      drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a female complaint; ye&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; find mony men bothered wi&rsquo;t unless
      they happen to be ministers. Ye&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; see Duffy sittin&rsquo; late at nicht
      knittin&rsquo; wee bootees for weans they&rsquo;ll never in this warld fit, nor
      crochetin&rsquo; doyleys, to aid the funds o&rsquo; the Celtic Fitba&rsquo; Club. Ye micht
      watch a lang while afore ye wad see me makin&rsquo; tinsey &lsquo;ool ornaments wi&rsquo; 
      paste-heided preens for hingin&rsquo; up in the best room o&rsquo; dacent folk that
      never did me ony hairm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There wad be nae such thing as bazaars if there werena ony weemen. In
      thoosands o&rsquo; weel-daein&rsquo; hames in this Christian toon o&rsquo; Gleska there&rsquo;s
      weemen at this very meenute neglectin&rsquo; their men&rsquo;s suppers to sit doon and
      think as hard&rsquo;s they can whit they can mak&rsquo; wi&rsquo; a cut and a half o&rsquo; 
      three-ply fingerin&rsquo; worsted, that&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; be ony use to onybody, but&rsquo;ll
      look worth eighteenpence in a bazaar. If ye miss your lum hat, and canna
      find it to gang to a funeral, ye may be shair it was cut in scollops a&rsquo; 
      roond the rim, and covered wi&rsquo; velvet, and that wee Jeanie pented flooers
      on&rsquo;t in her ain time to gie&rsquo;t the richt feenish for bein&rsquo; an Art
      work-basket at yer wife&rsquo;s stall in some bazaar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maist weemen start it withoot meanin&rsquo; ony hairm, maybe wi&rsquo; a
      table-centre, or a lamp-shade, or a pair o&rsquo; bedroom slippers. There&rsquo;s no&rsquo; 
      much wrang wi&rsquo; that; but it&rsquo;s a beginnin&rsquo;, and the habit grows on them
      till they&rsquo;re scoorin&rsquo; the country lookin&rsquo; for a chance to contribute whit
      they ca&rsquo; work to kirk bazaars and ony ither kinds o&rsquo; bazaars that&rsquo;s handy.
      It mak&rsquo;s my hert sair sometimes to see weel-put-on weemen wi&rsquo; men o&rsquo; their
      ain and dacent faimilies, comin&rsquo; hame through back-streets staggerin&rsquo; wi&rsquo; 
      parcels o&rsquo; remnants for dressin&rsquo; dolls or makin&rsquo; cushions wi&rsquo;. They&rsquo;ll
      hide it frae their men as long as they can, and then, when they&rsquo;re found
      oot, they&rsquo;ll brazen it oot and deny that it&rsquo;s ony great hairm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s wan way the trouble shows itsel&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s ither weemen&mdash;maistly younger and no&rsquo; mairried&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      dyin&rsquo; for a chance to be assistant stall-keepers, and wear white keps and
      aiprons, jist like tablemaids.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the kind I&rsquo;m feared for, and I&rsquo;m nae chicken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When they see a man come into the bazaar and nae wife wi&rsquo; him to tak&rsquo; 
      care o&rsquo; him, they come swoopin&rsquo; doon on him, gie him ony amount o&rsquo; deck,
      jist in fun, and ripe his pooches before he can button his jaicket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no&rsquo; sayin&rsquo; they put their hands in his pooches, but jist as bad; they
      look that nice, and sae fond o&rsquo; his tie and the way he has o&rsquo; wearin&rsquo; his
      moustache, that he&rsquo;s kittley doon to the soles o&rsquo; his feet, and wad buy a
      steam road-roller frae them if he had the money for&rsquo;t. But they&rsquo;re no&rsquo; 
      sellin&rsquo; steam road-rollers, the craturs! They&rsquo;re sellin&rsquo; shillin&rsquo; dolls at
      twa-and-six that can open and shut their een, and say &lsquo;Maw&rsquo; and &lsquo;Paw.&rsquo; 
      They&rsquo;re sellin&rsquo; carpet slippers, or bonny wee bunches o&rsquo; flooers, or
      raffle tickets for a rale heliotrope Persian cat. It&rsquo;s the flyest game I
      ken. When that puir sowl gets oot o&rsquo; the place wi&rsquo; naething in his pooches
      but his hands, and a dazed look in his een, the only thing he can mind is
      that she said her name was Maud, and that her hair was crimp, and that she
      didna put a preen in his coat-lapelle when she was puttin&rsquo; the shillin&rsquo; 
      rose there, because she said a preen wad cut love. She said that to every
      customer she had for her flooers that day, wi&rsquo; a quick look up in their
      face, and then droppin&rsquo; her eyes confused like, and her face red, and a&rsquo; 
      the time, her, as like as no&rsquo;, engaged to a man in India.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder hoo it wad dae to hae a man&rsquo;s bazaar? They ocht to have made the
      Freemason&rsquo;s bazaar a man&rsquo;s yin, seein&rsquo; the Freemasons &lsquo;ll no tell the
      weemen their secrets nor let them into their lodges.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man&rsquo;s bazaar wad be a rale divert: naethin&rsquo; to be sold in&rsquo;t but things
      for use, like meerschaum pipes, and kahootchy collars, and sox the richt
      size, and chairs, and tables, and concertinas&mdash;everything guaranteed
      to be made by men and them tryin&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The stalls wad be kept by a&rsquo; the baronets that could be scraped thegither
      and could be trusted withoot cash registers, and the stall assistants wad
      be the pick o&rsquo; the best-lookin&rsquo; men in the toon&mdash;if ye could get them
      sober enough. If Jinnet wad let me, I wad be willin&rsquo; to gie a hand mysel&rsquo;;
      for though I&rsquo;ve a flet fit I&rsquo;ve a warm hert, I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; ye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I see Duffy walkin&rsquo; roond the St Andrew&rsquo;s Hall, and it got up to
      look like the Fall o&rsquo; Babylon, tryin&rsquo; to sell bunches o&rsquo; flooers. Dae ye
      think he wad sell mony to the young chaps like whit Maud riped? Nae fears!
      He wad hae to tak&rsquo; every customer oot and stand him a drink afore he wad
      get a flooer aff his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can ye fancy Duffy gaun roond tryin&rsquo; to sell tickets for a raffle o&rsquo; a
      canary in a cage?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Here ye are, chaps and cairters! the chance o&rsquo; yer lifes for a grand
      whustler, and no&rsquo; ill to feed!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Na, na! a man o&rsquo; the Duffy stamp wad be nae use for a bazaar, even wi&rsquo; a
      dress suit on and his face washed. It wad need young stockbrokers, and
      chaps wi&rsquo; the richt kind o&rsquo; claes, wi&rsquo; a crease doon the front o&rsquo; their
      breeks&mdash;Gros-venor Restaurant chaps, wi&rsquo; the smell o&rsquo; cigars aff
      their topcoats, and either ca&rsquo;d Fred or Vincent. Then ye micht see that
      the ither sex that hiv a&rsquo; the best o&rsquo;t wi&rsquo; bazaars, the wye they&rsquo;re
      managed noo, wad flock to the man&rsquo;s bazaar and buy like onything. And
      maybe no&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Erchie rose off the drain-pipe, and prepared to resume his way home with
      that ingenious object that proves how the lowliest things of life may be
      made dignified and beautiful&mdash;if fashion says they are so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well; good night, old friend,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I hope Mrs MacPherson will be
      lucky and get the bicycle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dae ye, indeed?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Then ye&rsquo;re nae freen&rsquo; o&rsquo; mine. We&rsquo;re faur mair
      in the need o&rsquo; a mangle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you can exchange for one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no&rsquo; that shair. Did I ever tell ye I ance won a powney in a raffle?
      It was at the bazaar oor kirk had in Dr Jardine&rsquo;s time when they got the
      organ. I was helpin&rsquo; at the buffet, and I think they micht hae left me
      alane, me no&rsquo; bein&rsquo; there for fun, but at my tred, but wha cam&rsquo; cravin&rsquo; me
      to buy a ticket aff her but the doctor&rsquo;s guid-sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s three prizes,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;a powney wi&rsquo; broon harness, a marble
      nock, and a dizzen knifes and forks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I wad maybe risk it if it wisna for the powney,&rsquo; I tellt her; &lsquo;I havena
      kep&rsquo; a coachman for years, and I&rsquo;m oot o&rsquo; the way o&rsquo; drivin&rsquo; mysel&rsquo;.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh! ye needna be that feared, ye&rsquo;ll maybe no&rsquo; get the powney,&rsquo; said she,
      and I went awa&rsquo; like a fool and took the ticket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The draw took place jist when the bazaar was shuttin&rsquo; on the Setturday
      nicht. And I won the powney wi&rsquo; the broon harness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tore my ticket and thrieped it was a mistake, but I couldna get oot
      o&rsquo;t; they a&rsquo; kent the powney was mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was stabled behind the bazaar, and had to be ta&rsquo;en awa&rsquo; that nicht. I
      offered it to onybody that wanted it for naething, but naebody wad tak&rsquo; it
      aff my hands because they a&rsquo; said they had to tak&rsquo; the car hame, and they
      wadna be allooed to tak&rsquo; a powney into a car wi&rsquo; them. So they left me wi&rsquo; 
      a bonny-like prize.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I put its claes on the best way I could, fanklin&rsquo; a&rsquo; the straps, and
      dragged it hame. We lived in the close at the time, and I thocht maybe
      Jinnet wad let me keep it in the lobby till the Monday mornin&rsquo; till I
      could see whit I could dae. But she wadna hear tell o&rsquo;t. She said, it wad
      scrape a&rsquo; the waxcloth wi&rsquo; it&rsquo;s aim buits, and wad be a bonny-like thing
      to be nicherrin&rsquo; a&rsquo; Sunday, scandalisin&rsquo; the neebours, forbye there bein&rsquo; 
      nae gress in the hoose to feed it on. I said I wad rise early in the
      mornin&rsquo; and gaither denty-lions for&rsquo;t oot at the Three-Tree Well, but she
      wadna let me nor the powney inside the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasna an awfu&rsquo; big broad powney, but a wee smout o&rsquo; a thing they ca&rsquo; a
      Shetland shawl powney, and its harness didna fit it ony place at a&rsquo;. It
      looked at the twa o&rsquo; us, kind o&rsquo; dazed like.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ye&rsquo;re, no&rsquo; gaun to turn my hoose into a stable, and me jist cleaned it
      this very day,&rsquo; said Jinnet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And am I gaun to walk the streets a&rsquo; nicht wi&rsquo;t?&rsquo; I asked, near
      greetin&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Put it oot in the ash-pit, and the scavengers &lsquo;ll tak&rsquo; it awa&rsquo; in the
      mornin&rsquo;,&rsquo; she said, and I did that, forgettin&rsquo; that the mornin&rsquo; was the
      Sunday.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it didna maitter; the powney wasna there in the mornin&rsquo;, and I took
      guid care no&rsquo; to ask for&rsquo;t.&rdquo;

      XIV HOLIDAYS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>ell, Erchie; not
      away on the Fair holidays?&rdquo; I asked the old man one July day on meeting
      him as he came out of a little grocer&rsquo;s shop in the New City Road. The
      dignity of his profession is ever dear to Erchie; he kept his purchase
      behind his back, but I saw later it was kindling material for the morning
      fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not me!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nae Fair holidays for puir auld Erchie, no&rsquo; 
      even on the Sunday, or I might hae ta&rsquo;en the skoosh car doon the wye o&rsquo; 
      Yoker, noo that a hurl on Sunday&rsquo;s no&rsquo; that awfu&rsquo; sair looked doon on, or
      the &lsquo;Mornin&rsquo; Star&rsquo; &lsquo;bus to Paisley. But Jinnet went awa&rsquo; on Settur-day wi&rsquo; 
      her guid-sister to Dunoon, and I&rsquo;m my lee-lane in the hoose till the
      morn&rsquo;s mornin&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s nae divert, I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; ye; there&rsquo;s a lot o&rsquo; things
      to mind forbye the windin&rsquo; o&rsquo; the nock on Setturday and watering the
      fuchsia. I can wait a municeepal banquet wi&rsquo; ony man in my tred, but I&rsquo;m
      no&rsquo; great hand at cookin&rsquo; for mysel&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I ever tell ye aboot the time the wife was awa&rsquo; afore at a Fair, and
      I took a notion o&rsquo; a seedcake Duffy&rsquo;s first wife had to the tea she trated
      me to on the Sawbath?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s as easy to mak&rsquo; as boilin&rsquo; an egg,&rsquo; says Mrs Duffy, and gied me the
      receipt for&rsquo;t on con-deetion that when I made it I was to bring her a
      sample. Something went wrang, and I brought her the sample next day in a
      bottle. It was a gey damp seedcake thon!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I havena been awa&rsquo; at a Fair mysel&rsquo; since aboot the time Wullie was in
      the Foondry Boys, and used to gang to the Hielan&rsquo;s. I mind o&rsquo;t fine.
      Nooadays, in oor hoose, ye wad never jalouse it was the Fair at a&rsquo; if it
      wasna for the nae parridge in the mornin&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll hae noticed, maybe, that though we&rsquo;re a&rsquo; fearfu&rsquo; fond o&rsquo; oor
      parridge in Scotland, and some men mak&rsquo; a brag o&rsquo; takin&rsquo; them every
      mornin&rsquo; just as if they were a cauld bath, we&rsquo;re gey gled to skip them at
      a holiday, and just be daein&rsquo; wi&rsquo; ham and eggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But in thae days, as I was sayin&rsquo;, the Fair was something like the thing.
      There was Mumford&rsquo;s and Glenroy&rsquo;s shows, and if ye hadna the money to get
      in, ye could aye pap eggs at the musicianers playing on the ootside, and
      the thing was as broad as it was lang. Forbye ye didna get the name o&rsquo; 
      bein&rsquo; keen on the theatricals if your faither was parteecular.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mind ance I hit a skeely-e&rsquo;ed trombone, or maybe it was an awfuclyde,
      wi&rsquo; an egg at Vinegar Hill. The glee pairty&mdash;as ye might ca&rsquo; him if
      ye were funny&mdash;chased me as far doon as the Wee Doo Hill. I could rin
      in thae days; noo I&rsquo;ve ower flet feet, though I&rsquo;ve a warm hert too, I&rsquo;m
      tellin&rsquo; ye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If ye werena at the Shows in thae days ye went a trip wi&rsquo; the steamer <i>Bonnie
      Doon</i>, and ye had an awfu&rsquo; fine time o&rsquo;t on the Setturday if ye could
      jist mind aboot it on the Sunday mornin&rsquo;. Duffy&rsquo;s gey coorse, bein&rsquo; in the
      retail coal trade and cry in&rsquo; for himsel&rsquo;; I&rsquo;m no&rsquo; like that at a&rsquo; mysel&rsquo;;
      it widna dae, and me in the poseetion, but I mind ance o&rsquo; Duffy tellin&rsquo; me
      he could never fa&rsquo; asleep at the Fair Time till his wife gave him the idea
      o&rsquo; lyin&rsquo; on his left side, and coontin&rsquo; yin by yin a&rsquo; the drams he had the
      night afore. He said it worked on him like chloryform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope ye&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; mind me speakin&rsquo; aboot drink; it&rsquo;s awfu&rsquo; vulgar coonted
      noo, I hear, to let on ye ever heard that folk tak&rsquo; it, but in thae days
      there was an awfu&rsquo; lot o&rsquo;t partaken o&rsquo; aboot Gleska. I&rsquo;m tellt noo it&rsquo;s
      gaen clean oot o&rsquo; fashion, and stane ginger&rsquo;s a&rsquo; the go, and I see in the
      papers every Monday efter the Fair Setturday that &lsquo;there has been a
      gratifying decrease in the number o&rsquo; cases at the Central Police Court
      compared wi&rsquo; last year.&rsquo; I&rsquo;m that gled! I have been seein&rsquo; that bit o&rsquo; 
      news in the papers for the last thirty years, and I hae nae doot that in a
      year or twa drunks and disorderlies&rsquo;ll be sae scarce in Gleska at the
      Fair, the polis&rsquo;ll hae to gang huntin&rsquo; for them wi&rsquo; bloodhounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fine thing the Press. It&rsquo;s aye keen to keep oor herts up. Ye&rsquo;ll
      notice, perhaps, that at every Gleska holiday the papers aye say the
      croods that left the stations were unprecedented. They were never kent to
      be ony ither wye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daursay it&rsquo;s true enough. I went doon to the Broomielaw on Setturday to
      see Jinnet aff, and the croods on the Irish and Hielan&rsquo; boats was that
      awfu&rsquo;, the men at the steerage end hadna room to pu&rsquo; oot their
      pocket-hankies if they needed them. It&rsquo;s lucky they could dae withoot.
      When the butter-and-egg boats for Belfast and Derry left the quay, the
      pursers had a&rsquo; to have on twa watches&mdash;at least they had the twa
      watch-chains, ane on each side, for fear the steamer wad capsize. I says
      to mysel&rsquo;, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a peety a lot o&rsquo; thae folk for Clachnacudden and County
      Doon dinna lose their return tickets and bide awa&rsquo; when they&rsquo;re at it, for
      Gleska&rsquo;s a fine toon, but jist a wee bit owre crooded nooadays.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hae nae great notion for doon the watter mysel&rsquo; at the Fair. Jinnet
      jist goes and says she&rsquo;ll tell me whit it&rsquo;s like. Whit she likes it for is
      that ye&rsquo;re never lonely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And &lsquo;it&rsquo;s that homely doon aboot Rothesay and Dunoon, wi&rsquo; the Gleska
      wifes hangin&rsquo; ower the windows tryin&rsquo; as hard as they can to see the
      scenery, between the whiles they&rsquo;re fryin&rsquo; herrin&rsquo; for Wull. And then
      there&rsquo;s wee Hughie awfu&rsquo; ill wi&rsquo; eatin&rsquo; ower mony hairy grossets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s fine for the weans too, to be gaun sclimbin&rsquo; aboot the braes
      pu&rsquo;in&rsquo; the daisies and the dockens and the dentylions and&mdash;and&mdash;and
      a&rsquo; thae kin&rsquo; o&rsquo; flooers ye&rsquo;ll can touch withoot onybody findin&rsquo; fau&rsquo;t wi&rsquo; 
      ye. It&rsquo;s better for the puir wee smouts nor moshy in the back-coort, and
      puttin&rsquo; bunnets doon the stanks. They&rsquo;ll mind it a&rsquo; their days&mdash;the
      flooers and the dulse for naething, and the grossets and the Gregory&rsquo;s
      mixture. It&rsquo;s Nature; it&rsquo;s the Rale Oreeginal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does the wife a lot o&rsquo; guid to gae doon the watter at the Fair. She&rsquo;s
      that throng when she&rsquo;s at hame she hasna had time yet to try a new
      shooglin&rsquo;-chair we got at the flittin&rsquo;; but &lsquo;it&rsquo;s a rest,&rsquo; she&rsquo;ll say when
      she comes back, a&rsquo; moth-eaten wi&rsquo; the midges. And then she&rsquo;ll say, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
      that gled it&rsquo;s ower for the year.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the droll thing aboot the Fair and the New Year; ye&rsquo;re aye in the
      notion that somethin&rsquo; awfu&rsquo; nice is gaun to happen, and naethin&rsquo; happens
      at a&rsquo;, unless it&rsquo;s that ye get your hand awfu&rsquo; sair hashed pu&rsquo;in&rsquo; the cork
      oot o&rsquo; a bottle o&rsquo; beer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be glad, I&rsquo;m sure, to have the goodwife back, Erchie?&rdquo; I said,
      with an eye on the fire-kindlers.
    </p>
    <p>
      He betrayed some confusion at being discovered, and then laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye see I&rsquo;ve been for sticks,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a sample o&rsquo; my
      hoose-keepin&rsquo;. I kent there was something parteecular to get on the
      Setturday night, and thought it was pipeclye. The grocer in there wad be
      thinkin&rsquo; I was awa&rsquo; on the ping-pong if he didna ken I was a beadle. Will
      ye be puttin&rsquo; ony o&rsquo; this bit crack in the papers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know, Erchie; I hope you won&rsquo;t mind if I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m no heedin&rsquo;; it&rsquo;s a&rsquo; yin to Erchie, and does nae hairm to my
      repitation, though I think sometimes your spellin&rsquo;s a wee aff the plumb.
      Ye can say that I said keepin&rsquo; a hoose is like ridin&rsquo; the bicycle; ye
      think it&rsquo;s awfu&rsquo; easy till ye try&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a very old discovery, Erchie; I fail to understand why you should
      be anxious to have it published now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Erchie winked. &ldquo;I ken fine whit I&rsquo;m aboot,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll please the
      leddies to ken that Erchie said it, and I like fine to be popular. My
      private opeenion is that a man could keep a hoose as weel as a woman ony
      day if he could only bring his mind doon to&rsquo;t.&rdquo;

      XV THE STUDENT LODGER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was with genuine
      astonishment Erchie one day had his wife come to him with a proposal that
      she should keep a lodger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A ludger!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;It wad be mair like the thing if ye keepit a
      servant lassie, for whiles I think ye&rsquo;re fair wrocht aff yer feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m no&rsquo; sae faur done as a&rsquo; that,&rdquo; said Jinnet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m shair I&rsquo;m jist
      as smert on my feet as ever I was, and I could be daein&rsquo; wi&rsquo; a ludger
      fine. It wad keep me frae wearyin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wearyin&rsquo;!&rdquo; said her husband. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; to&rsquo;t when my ain &lsquo;wife tells me
      I&rsquo;m no&rsquo; company for her. Whit is&rsquo;t ye&rsquo;re wantin&rsquo;, and I&rsquo;ll see whit I can
      dae. If it&rsquo;s music ye&rsquo;re for, I&rsquo;ll buy a melodian and play&rsquo;t every nicht
      efter my tea. If it&rsquo;s improvin&rsquo; conversation ye feel the want o&rsquo;, I&rsquo;ll ask
      Duffy up every ither nicht and we&rsquo;ll can argue on Fore Ordination and the
      chance o&rsquo; the Celtic Fitba&rsquo; Club to win the League Championship the time
      ye&rsquo;re darnin&rsquo; stockin&rsquo;s. &lsquo;Wearyin&rsquo;&rsquo; says she! Perhaps ye wad like to jine
      a dancin&rsquo; school; weel, I&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; hinder ye, I&rsquo;m shair, but I&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; 
      promise to walk to the hall wi&rsquo; ye every nicht cairryin&rsquo; yer slippers.
      Start a ludger! I&rsquo;m shair we&rsquo;re no&rsquo; that hard up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, we&rsquo;re no&rsquo; that hard up,&rdquo; Jinnet confessed, &ldquo;but for a&rsquo; the use we
      mak&rsquo; o&rsquo; the room we micht hae somebody in it, and it wad jist be found
      money. I was jist thinkin&rsquo; it wad be kind o&rsquo; cheery to have a dacent young
      chap gaun oot and in. I&rsquo;m no&rsquo; for ony weemen ludgers; they&rsquo;re jist a fair
      bother, aye hingin&rsquo; aboot the hoose and puttin&rsquo; their nose into the
      kitchen, tellin&rsquo; ye the richt wye to dae this and that, and burnin&rsquo; coal
      and gas the time a man ludger wad be oot takin&rsquo; the air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Takin&rsquo; drink, mair likely,&rdquo; said Erchie, &ldquo;and comin&rsquo; hame singin&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;Sodgers o&rsquo; the Queen,&rsquo; and scandalisin&rsquo; the hale stair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m no&rsquo; for a tredsman,&rdquo; Jinnet went on, with the air of one whose
      plans were all made.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course no&rsquo;,&rdquo; said her husband, &ldquo;tredsmen&rsquo;s low. They&rsquo;re, no&rsquo; cless.
      It&rsquo;s a peety ye mairried yin. Perhaps ye&rsquo;re thinkin&rsquo; o&rsquo; takin&rsquo; in a
      Chartered Accoontant, or maybe a polisman. Weel I&rsquo;m jist tellin&rsquo; ye I
      wadna hae a polisman in my paurlor; his helmet wadna gang richt wi&rsquo; the
      furniture, and the blecknin&rsquo; for his boots wad cost ye mair than whit he
      pyed for his room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nor a polisman!&rdquo; said Jinnet. &ldquo;I was thinkin&rsquo; o&rsquo; maybe a quate lad in
      a warehouse, or a nice factor&rsquo;s clerk, or something o&rsquo; that sort. He wad
      be nae bother. It&rsquo;s jist the ae makin&rsquo; o&rsquo; parridge in the mornin&rsquo;. Ye&rsquo;re
      no&rsquo; to thraw wi&rsquo; me aboot this, Erchie; my mind&rsquo;s made up I&rsquo;m gaun to keep
      a ludger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If your mind&rsquo;s made up,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;then there&rsquo;s nae use o&rsquo; me
      argy-bargyin&rsquo; wi&rsquo; ye. I&rsquo;m only your man. It bates me to ken whit ye&rsquo;re
      gaun to dae wi&rsquo; the money, if it&rsquo;s no&rsquo; to buy a motor-cairrage. Gie me
      your word ye&rsquo;re no&rsquo; gaun in for ony sports o&rsquo; that kind. I wad hate to see
      ony wife o&rsquo; mine gaun skooshin&rsquo; oot the Great Western Road on a machine
      like a tar-biler, wi&rsquo; goggles on her een and a kahoutchy trumpet
      skriechin&rsquo; &lsquo;pip! pip!&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re jist an auld haver,&rdquo; said Jinnet, and turned to her sewing, her
      point gained.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fortnight after, as a result of a ticket with the legend &ldquo;Apartments&rdquo; in
      the parlour window, Jinnet was able to meet her husband&rsquo;s return to tea
      one night with the announcement that she had got a lodger. &ldquo;A rale
      gentleman!&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;That weel put-on! wi&rsquo; twa Gled-stone bags, yin
      o&rsquo; them carpet, and an alerm clock for waukenin&rsquo; him in the mornin&rsquo;. He
      cam&rsquo; this efternoon in a cab, and I think he&rsquo;ll be easy put up wi&rsquo; and
      tak&rsquo; jist whit we tak&rsquo; oorsels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope he&rsquo;s no&rsquo; a theatrical,&rdquo; said Erchie. &ldquo;Me bein&rsquo; a beadle in a kirk
      it wadna be becomin&rsquo; to hae a theatrical for a ludger. Forbye, they never
      rise oot o&rsquo; their beds on the Sunday, but lie there drinkin&rsquo; porter and
      readin&rsquo; whit the papers says aboot their playactin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nor a theatrical!&rdquo; cried Jinnet. &ldquo;I wadna mak&rsquo; a show o&rsquo; my hoose for
      ony o&rsquo; them: it&rsquo;s a rale nice wee fair-heided student.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Erchie threw up his hands in amazement. &ldquo;Michty me!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;a student.
      Ye micht as weel hae taen in a brass baun&rsquo; or the Cairter&rsquo;s Trip when ye
      were at it. Dae ye ken whit students is, Jinnet? I ken them fine, though I
      was never at the college mysel&rsquo;, but yince I was engaged to hand roond
      beer at whit they ca&rsquo;d a Gaudiamus. Ye have only to tak&rsquo; the mildest wee
      laddie that has bad e&rsquo;e-sicht and subject to sair heids frae the country
      and mak&rsquo; a student o&rsquo; him to rouse the warst passions o&rsquo; his nature. His
      mither, far awa&rsquo; in Clachnacudden, thinks he&rsquo;s hurtin&rsquo; his health wi&rsquo; ower
      muckle study, but the only hairm he&rsquo;s daein&rsquo; himsel&rsquo; is to crack his voice
      cryin&rsquo; oot impidence to his professors. I&rsquo;m vexed it&rsquo;s a student, and a
      fair-heided yin at that: I&rsquo;ve noticed that the fair-heided yins were aye
      the warst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weel, he&rsquo;s there onywye, and we&rsquo;ll jist hae to mak&rsquo; the best we can wi&rsquo; 
      him,&rdquo; said Jinnet. &ldquo;Forbye, I think he&rsquo;s a guid-leevin&rsquo; lad, Erchie; he
      tellt me he was comin&rsquo; oot for a minister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Comin&rsquo; oot for a minister!&rdquo; said Erchie. &ldquo;Then that&rsquo;s the last straw! I&rsquo;m
      sorry for your chevalier and book-case; he&rsquo;ll be sclimbin&rsquo; int&rsquo;t some
      nicht thinkin&rsquo; it&rsquo;s the concealed bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The room door opened, a voice bawled in the lobby, &ldquo;Mrs MacPherson, hey!
      Mrs MacPherson,&rdquo; and the student, without waiting his
      landlady&rsquo;s-appearance, walked coolly into the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hulloo! old chap, how&rsquo;s biz?&rdquo; he said to Erchie, and seated himself
      airily on the table, with a pipe in his mouth. He was a lad of twenty,
      with spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I canna complain,&rdquo; said Erchie. &ldquo;I hope ye&rsquo;re makin&rsquo; yersel&rsquo; at hame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me for that!&rdquo; said the student.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s nice,&rdquo; said Erchie, blandly. &ldquo;See and no&rsquo; be ower blate, and if
      there&rsquo;s onything ye&rsquo;re wantin&rsquo; that we havena got, we&rsquo;ll get it for ye.
      Ye&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; know whit ye need till ye see whit ye require. It&rsquo;s a prood day
      for us to hae a diveenity student in oor room. If we had expected it we
      wad hae had a harmonium.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind the harmonium,&rdquo; said the student. &ldquo;For music lean on me,
      George P. Tod. I sing from morn till dewy eve. When I get up in the
      morning, jocund day stands on the misty mountain top, and I give weight
      away to the bloomin&rsquo; lark. Shakespeare, Mr MacPherson. The Swan of Avon.
      He wrote a fairly good play. What I wanted to know was if by any chance
      Mrs MacPherson was a weepist?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir?&rdquo; said Jinnet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you, by any chance, let the tear doon fa&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not me!&rdquo; said Jinnet, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a cheery wee woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said Tod. &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re lucky to secure a sympathetic and desirable
      lodger. To be gay is my forte. The last landlady I had was thrice a widow.
      She shed the tears of unavailing regret into my lacteal nourishment with
      the aid of a filler, I think, and the milk got thinner and thinner. I was
      compelled at last to fold-my tent like the justly celebrated Arabs of song
      and silently steal away. &lsquo;Why weep ye by the tide, ladye?&rsquo; I said to her.
      &lsquo;If it were by the pint I should not care so much, but methinks your
      lachrymal ducts are too much on the hair trigger.&rsquo; It was no use, she
      could not help it, and&mdash;in short, here I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m shair we&rsquo;ll dae whit we can for ye,&rdquo; said Jinnet. &ldquo;I never had a
      ludger before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better,&rdquo; said George Tod. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m delighted to be the object of
      experiment&mdash;the <i>corpus vile</i>, as we say in the classics, Mr
      MacPher-son,&mdash;and you will learn a good deal with me. I will now
      proceed to burn the essential midnight oil. Ah, thought, thought! You
      little know, Mr MacPherson, the weary hours of study&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no&rsquo; ile we hae in the room, it&rsquo;s gas,&rdquo; said Erchie. &ldquo;But if ye wad
      raither hae ile&rsquo;, say the word and we&rsquo;ll get it for ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gas will do,&rdquo; said the student; &ldquo;it is equally conducive to study, and
      more popular in all great congeries of thought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When dae ye rise in the mornin&rsquo;, Mr Tod?&rdquo; asked Jinnet. &ldquo;I wad like to
      ken when I should hae your breakfast ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rise!&rdquo; said Tod. &ldquo;Oh, any time! &lsquo;When the morn, with russet mantle clad,
      walks o&rsquo;er the dew on yon high eastern hill.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0004" id="linkimage-0004"> </a>

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0113.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is&rsquo;t Garnethill or Gilshochill?&rdquo; said Erchie, anxiously. &ldquo;I wad rise,
      mysel&rsquo;, early in the mornin&rsquo;, and gang oot to whichever o&rsquo; them it is to
      see the first meenute the dew comes, so that ye wadna lose ony time in
      gettin&rsquo; up and started wi&rsquo; your wark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lodger for the first time looked at his landlord with a suspicious
      eye. He had a faint fear that the old man might be chaffing him, but the
      innocence of Erchie&rsquo;s face restored his perkiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was only quoting the bard,&rdquo; he explained, as he left the kitchen.
      &ldquo;Strictly speaking, the morn with russet mantle clad can go to the deuce
      for me, for I have an alarm clock. Do not be startled if you hear it in
      the morning. It goes off with incredible animation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Erchie&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t he nice?&rdquo; said Jinnet, when the lodger had withdrawn.
      &ldquo;That smert, and aye talks that jovial, wi&rsquo; a lot o&rsquo; words I canna mak&rsquo; 
      heid nor tail o&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Erchie filled his pipe and thought a little. &ldquo;Smert&rsquo;s the word, Jinnet,&rdquo;
       said he. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s whit students is for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s very strong,&rdquo; said Jinnet. &ldquo;If he was in his mither&rsquo;s
      hoose she wad be giein&rsquo; him hough soup for his dinner. I think I&rsquo;ll jist
      mak&rsquo; some for him to-morrow, and put a hot-water bottle in his bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s richt,&rdquo; said Erchie; &ldquo;and if ye hae a haddie or a kippered
      herrin&rsquo;, or onything else handy, it&rsquo;ll dae for me.&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re jist a haver!&rdquo; said Jinnet.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a week George P. Tod was a model lodger. He came in at early hours of
      the evening and went to bed timeously, and was no great trouble to his
      landlady, whose cookery exploits in his interest were a great improvement
      on anything he had ever experienced in lodgings before.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was in his room in the evenings Jinnet insisted on the utmost
      quietness on the part of her husband. &ldquo;Mr Tod&rsquo;s at his hame lessons,&rdquo; she
      would say. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; dae to disturb him. Oh, that heid wark! that heid
      wark! It must be an awfu&rsquo; thing to hae to be thinkin&rsquo; even-on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heid wark!&rdquo; said her husband. &ldquo;I ken the heid wark he&rsquo;s like enough at;
      he&rsquo;s learnin&rsquo; the words o&rsquo; &lsquo;Mush Mush, tu-ral-i-ady&rsquo; to sing at the
      students&rsquo; procession, or he&rsquo;s busy wi&rsquo; a dictionary writin&rsquo; hame to his
      paw to send him a post office order for twa pounds to jine the Y.M.C.A.
      But he&rsquo;s no&rsquo; thinkin&rsquo; o&rsquo; jinin&rsquo; the Y.M.C.A.; he&rsquo;s mair likely to start
      takin&rsquo; lessons at a boxin&rsquo; cless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But even Erchie was compelled to admit that the lad was no unsatisfactory
      lodger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I declare, Jinnet,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s yin o&rsquo; the kind o&rsquo; students ye
      read aboot but very seldom see. His faither&rsquo;ll be a wee fairmer up aboot
      Clachnacudden, hainin&rsquo; a&rsquo; the money he can, and no&rsquo; giein&rsquo; his wife her
      richt meat, that he may see his son through the college and waggin&rsquo; his
      heid in a pulpit. Him and his faither&rsquo;s the stuff they mak&rsquo; the six
      shillin&rsquo; Scotch novells oot o&rsquo;&mdash;the kind ye greet at frae the very,
      start,&mdash;for ye ken the puir lad, that was aye that smert in the
      school, and won a&rsquo; the bursaries, is gaun to dee in the last chapter wi&rsquo; a
      decline.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Puir things,&rdquo; said Jinnet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye divna see ony signs o&rsquo; decline aboot Mr Tod, do ye?&rdquo; asked Erchie,
      anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didna notice,&rdquo; replied Jinnet, &ldquo;but he taks his meat weel enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The meat&rsquo;s the main thing! But watch you if he hasna a hoast and thon
      hectic flush that aye breaks oot in chapter nine jist aboot the time he
      wins the gold medal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Och, ye&rsquo;re jist an auld haver, Erchie,&rdquo; said the wife. &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re no&rsquo; to be
      frichtenin&rsquo; me aboot the puir callant, jist the same age as oor ain
      Willie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The time of the Rectorial Election approached, and Tod began to display
      some erratic habits. It was sometimes the small hours of the morning
      before he came home, and though he had a latchkey, Jinnet could never go
      to bed until her lodger was in for the night. Sometimes she went out to
      the close-mouth to look if he might be coming, and the first night that,
      Erchie, coming home late from working at a civic banquet, found her there,
      Tod narrowly escaped being told to take his two bags and his alarm clock
      elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was needin&rsquo; a moothfu&rsquo; o&rsquo; fresh air onywye,&rdquo; was Jinnet&rsquo;s excuse for
      being out at such an hour. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m feared that puir lad&rsquo;s workin&rsquo; himsel&rsquo; 
      to death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whaur dae ye think he&rsquo;s toilin&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the nicht-school,&rdquo; said Jinnet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m shair the college through the
      day&rsquo;s plenty for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The nicht-school!&rdquo; cried Erchie. &ldquo;Bonny on the nicht-school! He&rsquo;s mair
      likely to be roond in Gibson Street batterin&rsquo; in the doors o&rsquo; the
      Conservative committee-rooms, for I ken by his specs and his plush weskit
      he&rsquo;s a Leeberal. Come awa&rsquo; in to your bed and never mind him. Ye wad be
      daein&rsquo; him a better turn maybe if ye chairged the gazogene to be ready for
      the mornin&rsquo;, when he&rsquo;ll be badly wantin&rsquo;t, if I&rsquo;m no&rsquo; faur mistaken.&rdquo;
       Erchie was right&mdash;the-gazogene would have been welcome next morning.
      As it was, the lodger was indifferent to breakfast, and expressed an
      ardent desire for Health Salts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Erchie took them in to him, and found him groaning with a headache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dew&rsquo;s awfu&rsquo; late on the high eastern hills this mornin&rsquo;, Mr Tod,&rdquo;
       said Erchie. &ldquo;Losh, ye&rsquo;re as gash as the Laird o&rsquo; Garscadden! I&rsquo;m feart
      ye&rsquo;re studyin&rsquo; far ower hard; it&rsquo;s no&rsquo; for the young and growin&rsquo; to be
      hurtin&rsquo; their heids wi&rsquo; nicht-schools and day-schools; ye should whiles
      tak&rsquo; a bit rest to yersel&rsquo;. And no&rsquo; a bit o&rsquo; yer breakfast touched! Mrs
      MacPherson&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; be the pleased woman wi&rsquo; ye this day, I can tell ye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tod looked up with a lack-lustre eye. &ldquo;Thought, Mr MacPherson, thought!&rdquo;
       said he. &ldquo;Hard, incessant, brain-corroding thought! In the words of the
      Bard of Avon, &lsquo;He who increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I aye thocht that was &lsquo;Ecclesiastes,&rsquo; Mr Tod,&rdquo; said Erchie, meekly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a way, yes,&rdquo; hastily admitted Tod. &ldquo;It <i>was</i> &lsquo;Ecclesiastes,&rsquo; as
      you say; but Shakespeare had pretty much the same idea. You will find it
      in&mdash;in&mdash;in his plays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That afternoon began the more serious of Jinnet&rsquo;s experiences of&rsquo; divinity
      students. Nine young gentlemen with thick walking-sticks visited Tod&rsquo;s
      apartment <i>en masse</i>; the strains of &ldquo;Mush Mush, tu-ral-i-ady,&rdquo;
       bellowed inharmoniously by ten voices, and accompanied by the beating of
      the walking-sticks on the floor, kept a crowd of children round the
      close-mouth for hours, and somewhat impeded the ordinary traffic of the
      street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There must be a spree on in auld Mac-Pherson&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said the tenement. When
      Erchie came home he found Jinnet distracted. &ldquo;Oh, whit a day I&rsquo;ve had wi&rsquo; 
      them students!&rdquo; she wailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But look at the money ye&rsquo;re makin&rsquo; aff your room,&rdquo; said her husband. &ldquo;Wi&rsquo; 
      whit ye get frae Tod, ye&rsquo;ll soon hae enough for the motor, cairrage and a
      yacht forbye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m feart to tell ye, Erchie,&rdquo; said Jinnet, &ldquo;but I havena seen the colour
      o&rsquo; his money yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Study! study!&rdquo; said Erchie. &ldquo;Ye canna expect the puir lad to be thinkin&rsquo; 
      even-on aboot his lessons, and learnin&rsquo; Latin and the rest o&rsquo;t, no&rsquo; to
      mention &lsquo;Mush Mush,&rsquo; and still keep mind o&rsquo; your twa or three paltry
      bawbees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mentioned it to him on Setturday and he was rale annoyed. He yoked on
      me and said I was jist as bad as the weedow he lodged wi&rsquo; afore; that he
      was shair I was gaun to let the tear doon-fa&rsquo;. He gied me warnin&rsquo; that if
      I let the tear doon-fa&rsquo; he wad leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I was you I wad start greetin&rsquo; at yince,&rdquo; said Erchie. &ldquo;And he&rsquo;ll
      leave onywye, this very Setturday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That afternoon the students were having a torchlight procession, when, as
      usual, most of them marched in masquerade. It was the day of the Rectorial
      Election, and the dust of far-flung pease-meal&mdash;favourite missile of
      the student&mdash;filled the air all over the classic slopes of
      Gilmorehill. It had been one of Erchie&rsquo;s idle days; he had been in the
      house all afternoon, and still was unbedded, though Jinnet for once had
      retired without waiting the home-coming of her lodger.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came a riotous singing of student&rsquo;s along the street, accompanied by
      the wheezy strains of a barrel-organ, and for twenty minutes uproar
      reigned at the entrance to the MacPherson&rsquo;s close.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Tod came up and opened the door with his latch-key. He had on part of
      Erchie&rsquo;s professional habiliments&mdash;the waiter&rsquo;s dress-coat and also
      Erchie&rsquo;s Sunday silk hat, both surreptitiously taken from a press in the
      lobby. They were foul with pease-meal and the melted rosin from torches.
      On his shoulders Tod had strapped a barrel-organ, and the noise of it, as
      it thumped against the door-posts on his entry, brought Erchie out to see
      what was the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took in the situation at a glance, though at first he did not recognise
      his own clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s you, Mr Tod!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I was jist sittin&rsquo; here thinkin&rsquo; on ye
      slavin&rsquo; awa&rsquo; at your lessons yonder in the Deveenity Hall. It maun be an
      awfu&rsquo; strain on the intelleck. I&rsquo;m gled I never went to the college
      mysel&rsquo;, but jist got my education, as it were, by word o&rsquo; mooth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tod breathed heavily. He looked very foolish with his borrowed and
      begrimed clothes, and the organ on his back, and he realised the fact
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;S all ri&rsquo;, Mr MacPherson,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Music hath charms. Not a word! I
      found this&mdash;this instrument outside, and just took it home. Thought
      it might be useful. Music in the house makes cheerful happy homes&mdash;see
      advertisements&mdash;so I borrowed this from old friend, what&rsquo;s name
      &mdash;Angina Pectoris, Italian virtuosa, leaving him the monkey. Listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He unslung the organ and was starting to play it in the lobby when Erchie
      caught him by the arm and restrained him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Canny, man, canny,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Did I no&rsquo; think it was a box wi&rsquo; your
      bursary. I never kent richt whit a bursary was, but the lad o&rsquo; pairts in
      the novells aye comes hame wi&rsquo; a bursary, and hurts the spine o&rsquo; his back
      carryin&rsquo; his prizes frae the college. I jalouse that&rsquo;s the hectic flush on
      your face; puir laddie, ye&rsquo;re no&rsquo; lang for this warld.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Erchie stared more closely at his lodger, and for the first time
      recognised his own swallow-tail coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My goodness!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;my business coat, and my beadlin&rsquo; hat. It was
      rale ill-done o&rsquo; ye, Mr Tod, to tak&rsquo; them oot withoot my leave. It&rsquo;s the
      first time ever I was ashamed o&rsquo; them. Jist a puir auld waiter&rsquo;s coat and
      hat. I wonder whit they wad say if they kent o&rsquo;t up in Clachna-cudden. The
      auld dominie that was sae prood o&rsquo; ye wad be black affronted. My business
      coat! Tak&rsquo; it aff and gang to your bed like a wise man. Leave the
      hurdy-gurdy on the stair-heid; ye divna ken whit the other monkey micht
      hae left aboot it, and Jinnet&rsquo;s awfu&rsquo; parteecular.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next day Mr Tod got a week&rsquo;s notice to remove, and went reluctantly, for
      he knew good lodgings when he got them. He paid his bill when he went,
      too, &ldquo;like a gentleman,&rdquo; as Jinnet put it. &ldquo;He was a rale cheery wee
      chap,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen faur worse,&rdquo; Erchie admitted&rsquo;. &ldquo;Foolish a wee, but Nature, the
      Rale Oreeginal! I was gey throughither mysel&rsquo; when I was his age. Ye never
      tellt me yet whit ye wanted wi&rsquo; the ludging money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was jist thinkin&rsquo; I wad like to see ye wi&rsquo; a gold watch the same as
      Carmichael&rsquo;s, next door,&rdquo; said Jinnet. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a thing a man at your time o&rsquo; 
      life, and in your poseetion, should hae, and I was ettlin&rsquo; to gie ye&rsquo;t for
      your New Year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A gold watch!&rdquo; cried her husband. &ldquo;Whit nonsense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no&rsquo; nonsense at a&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Jinnet. &ldquo;It gies a man a kind o&rsquo; bien,
      weel-daein&rsquo; look, and I thocht I could mak&rsquo; enough aff ludgers to buy ye
      yin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it was for that ye wanted the ludger, and no&rsquo; for a motor cairrage,&rdquo;
       said Erchie, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gled Tod&rsquo;s awa&rsquo;. You and your watch! I wad be a bonny
      like la-di-da wi&rsquo; a watch at the waitin&rsquo;; the folks wad be feared to tip
      me in case I wad be angry wi&rsquo; them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so Erchie has not yet got a gold watch.
    </p>

      XVI JINNET&rsquo;S TEA-PARTY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">E</span>rchie&rsquo;s goodwife
      came to him one day full of thrilling news from the dairy, where she had
      been for twopence worth of sticks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Erchie, dae ye ken the latest?&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;The big fat yin in the
      dairy&rsquo;s gaun to mairry Duffy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord peety Duffy! Somebody should tell the puir sowl she has her e&rsquo;e on
      him. I&rsquo;ll bate ye he disna&rsquo; ken onything aboot it,&rdquo; said Erchie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Havers!&rdquo; said Jinnet. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s him that&rsquo;s wantin&rsquo; her, and I&rsquo;m shair it&rsquo;s a
      guid thing, for his hoose is a&rsquo; gaun to wreck and ruin since his last wife
      dee&rsquo;d. Every time he comes hame to dry his claes on a wet day he&rsquo;s doon in
      the dairy for anither bawbee&rsquo;s worth o&rsquo; mulk. The man&rsquo;s fair hoved up wi&rsquo; 
      drinkin&rsquo; mulk he&rsquo;s no&rsquo; needin&rsquo;. I hae catched him there that aften that
      he&rsquo;s kind o&rsquo; affronted to see me. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m here again, Mrs MacPherson,&rsquo; says
      he to me yesterday when I went doon and found him leanin&rsquo; ower the coonter
      wi&rsquo; a tumbler in his haund. He was that ta&rsquo;en he nearly dropped the
      gless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasna for the want o&rsquo; practice&mdash;I&rsquo;ll wager ye that!&rdquo; said Erchie.
      &ldquo;He could haud a schooner a hale nicht and him haulf sleepin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m here again,&rsquo; says he, onywye; &lsquo;the doctor tellt me yon time I had
      the illness I was to keep up my strength. There&rsquo;s a lot o&rsquo; nourishment in
      mulk.&rsquo; And the big yin&rsquo;s face was as red as her short-goon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a blessin&rsquo; the health, Mr Duffy,&rsquo; says I; &lsquo;we divna ken whit a
      mercy it is till we lose it,&rsquo; and I never said anither word, but took my
      bit sticks and cam&rsquo; awa&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is that a&rsquo; ye hae to gang on to be blamin&rsquo; the chap?&rdquo; said Erchie.
      &ldquo;Mony&rsquo;s a man&rsquo;ll tak&rsquo; a gless o&rsquo; mulk and no&rsquo; go ower faur wi&rsquo;t. But I
      think mysel&rsquo; ye&rsquo;re maybe richt aboot the big yin, for I see Duffy&rsquo;s shaved
      aff his Paisley whiskers, and wears a tie on the Sundays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Less than a week later the girl in the dairy gave in her notice, and Duffy
      put up the price of coals another ha&rsquo;penny. He came up the stair with two
      bags for Jinnet, who was one of his customers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whit wye are they up a bawbee the day?&rdquo; says she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s because o&rsquo; the Americans dumpin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Duffy. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re takin&rsquo; a&rsquo; 
      the tred frae us, and there&rsquo;s a kind o&rsquo; tariff war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me!, is there, anither war?&rdquo; said Jinnet. &ldquo;Weel, they&rsquo;re gettin&rsquo; a
      fine day for&rsquo;t onywye. I hope it&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; put up the price o&rsquo; the mulk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Duffy looked at her and laughed uneasily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m kind o&rsquo; aff the mulk diet
      the noo,&rdquo; he said, seeing disguise was useless. &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re gey gleg, you
      weemen. I needna be tellin&rsquo; ye me and big Leezie&rsquo;s sort o&rsquo; chief this
      while back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man! dae ye tell me?&rdquo; said Jinnet, innocently. &ldquo;A rale dacent lassie, and
      bakes a bonny scone. And she&rsquo;s to be the new mistress, is she? We&rsquo;ll hae
      to be savin&rsquo; up for the jeely-pan. I&rsquo;m shair I aye tellt Erchie a wife was
      sair wanted in your hoose since Maggie dee&rsquo;d.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jist at the very time I was thrangest,&rdquo; said Duffy, with regret. &ldquo;I was
      awfu&rsquo; chawed at her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll hae to bring yer lass up to see me and Erchie some nicht,&rdquo; said
      Jinnet. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a tryin&rsquo; time the mairryin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There faur ower mony palavers aboot it,&rdquo; confided the coalman. &ldquo;I wish it
      was ower and done wi&rsquo;, and I could get wearin&rsquo; my grauvit at nicht again.
      Leezie&rsquo;s awfu&rsquo; pernicketty aboot me haein&rsquo; on a collar when we gang for a
      walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, ye rascal!&rdquo; said Jinnet roguishly. &ldquo;You men! you men! Ah, the
      coortin&rsquo; time&rsquo;s the best time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ach! it&rsquo;s richt enough, I daursay; but there&rsquo;s a lot o&rsquo; nonsense aboot
      it. Ye get awfu&rsquo; cauld feet standin&rsquo; in the close. And it&rsquo;s aye in yer
      mind. I went to Leezie&rsquo;s close-mooth the ither nicht to whistle on her,
      and did I no&rsquo; forget, and cry oot &lsquo;Coal!&rsquo; thinkin&rsquo; I was on business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And thus it was that Jinnet&rsquo;s tea-party came about. The tender pair of
      pigeons were the guests of honour, and Jinnet&rsquo;s niece, and Macrae the
      night policeman, were likewise invited. Macrae was there because Jinnet
      thought her niece at thirty-five was old enough to marry. Jinnet did not
      know that he had drunk milk in Leezie&rsquo;s dairy before Duffy had gone there,
      and he himself had come quite unsuspicious of whom he should meet. In all
      innocence Jinnet had brought together the elements of tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something cold in the atmosphere of the party. Erchie noticed
      it. &ldquo;Ye wad think it was a Quaker&rsquo;s meetin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said to himself as all
      his wife&rsquo;s efforts to encourage an airy conversation dismally failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See and mak&rsquo; yer tea o&rsquo;t, Mr Macrae,&rdquo; she said to the night policeman.
      &ldquo;And you, Sarah, I wish ye would tak&rsquo; yin o&rsquo; thae penny things, and pass
      the plate to Mr Duffy. Ye&rsquo;ll excuse there bein&rsquo; nae scones, Mr Duffy;
      there hasna been a nice scone baked in the dairy since Leezie left.
      There&rsquo;s wan thing ye&rsquo;ll can be shair o&rsquo; haein&rsquo; when ye&rsquo;re mairret till
      her, and that&rsquo;s guid bakin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Macrae snorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the maitter wi&rsquo; dough-feet, I wonder?&rdquo; thought Erchie, as innocent
      as his wife was of any complication. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the worst o&rsquo; askin&rsquo; the polis
      to yer pairties,&mdash;they&rsquo;re no&rsquo; cless; and I&rsquo;m shair, wi&rsquo; a&rsquo; Jinnet&rsquo;s
      contrivance, Sarah wadna be made up wi&rsquo; him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A wee tate mair tea, Mr Macrae? Leezie, gie me Mr Macrae&rsquo;s cup if it&rsquo;s
      oot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Macrae snorted again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not pe puttin&rsquo; her to the bother, Mrs
      MacPherson,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Murdo Macrae can pe passin&rsquo; his own teacups wisout botherin&rsquo; anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dough-feet&rsquo;s in the dods,&rdquo; thought Erchie, to whom the whole situation
      was now, for the first time, revealed like a flash.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, Jinnet,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;ye wad hae been nane the waur o&rsquo; a pun&rsquo; or
      twa o&rsquo; conversation-losengers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They ate oranges after tea, but still a depression hung upon the company
      like a cloud, till Erchie asked Macrae if he would sing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Onything ye like,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as lang&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s no&rsquo; yin o&rsquo; yer tartan chats
      that has a hunder verses, and that needs ye to tramp time wi&rsquo; yer feet
      till&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve a flet fit mysel&rsquo;, though my hert&rsquo;s warm, and I&rsquo;m nae use at
      batin&rsquo; time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Macrae looked at Leezie, who had all night studiously evaded his eye,
      cleared his throat, and started to sing a song with the chorus&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;Fause Maggie Jurdan,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      She"made my life a burden;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      I don&rsquo;t want to live,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      And I&rsquo;m gey sweart to dee.
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      She&rsquo;s left me a&rsquo; forlorn,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      And I wish I&rsquo;d ne&rsquo;er been born,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Since fause Maggie Jurdan
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Went and jilted me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Leezie only heard one verse, and then began hysterically to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look you here, Mac,&rdquo; broke in Erchie, &ldquo;could ye no&rsquo; mak&rsquo; it the sword
      dance, or the Hoolichan, or something that wadna harrow oor feelin&rsquo;s this
      way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Onything that&rsquo;ll gie us a rest,&rdquo; said Duffy, soothing his fiancee. &ldquo;The
      nicht air&rsquo;s evidently no&rsquo; very guid for the voice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coals!&rdquo; cried the policeman, in a very good imitation of Duffy&rsquo;s business
      wail; and at that Leezie had to be assisted into the kitchen by the other
      two women.
    </p>
    <p>
      Duffy glared at his jealous and defeated rival, thought hard of something
      withering to hurl at him, and then said &ldquo;Saps!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What iss that you are saying?&rdquo; asked Macrae. &ldquo;Saps! Big Saps! That&rsquo;s jist
      whit ye are,&rdquo; said Duffy. &ldquo;If I wasna engaged I wad gie ye yin in the
      ear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jinnet&rsquo;s tea-party broke up as quickly as possible after that. When her
      guests had gone, and she found herself alone in the kitchen with Erchie
      and the tea dishes he carried in for her, she fell into a chair and wept.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never hae anither tea-pairty, and that&rsquo;s tellin&rsquo; ye,&rdquo; she exclaimed
      between her sobs. &ldquo;Fancy a&rsquo; that cairry-on ower a big, fat, cat-witted
      cratur like thon! Her and her lads!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a&rsquo; richt, Jinnet,&rdquo; said Erchie; &ldquo;you syne oot the dishes and I&rsquo;ll
      dry them if ye&rsquo;ll feenish yer greetin&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s no&rsquo; the last tea-pairty we&rsquo;ll
      hae if we hae oor health, but the next yin ye hae see and pick the company
      better.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      XVII THE NATIVES OF CLACHNACUDDEN
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">Y</span>ou are looking
      somewhat tired, Erchie,&rdquo; I said to the old man on Saturday. &ldquo;I suppose you
      were waiter at some dinner last night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not me!&rdquo; said he promptly. &ldquo;I wasna at my tred at a&rsquo; last nicht; I was
      wi&rsquo; Jinnet at the Clachnacudden conversashion. My! but we&rsquo;re gettin&rsquo; 
      grand. You should hae seen the twa o&rsquo; us sittin&rsquo; as hard as onything in a
      corner o&rsquo; the hall watchin&rsquo; the young yins dancin&rsquo;, and wishin&rsquo; we were
      hame. Och, it&rsquo;s a fine thing a conversashion; there&rsquo;s naething wrang wi&rsquo;t;
      it&rsquo;s better nor standin&rsquo; aboot the street corners, or haudin&rsquo; up the
      coonter at the Mull o&rsquo; Kintyre Vaults. But I&rsquo;ll tell ye whit, it&rsquo;s no&rsquo; 
      much o&rsquo; a game for an auld couple weel ower sixty, though no&rsquo; compleenin&rsquo;,
      and haein&rsquo; their health, and able to read the smallest type withoot specs.
      I wadna hae been there at a&rsquo;, but Macrae, the nicht polisman that&rsquo;s efter
      Jinnet&rsquo;s niece, cam&rsquo; cravin&rsquo; me to buy tickets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m no&rsquo; a Clachnacudden native,&rsquo; says I till him. &lsquo;If it was a reunion
      o&rsquo; the natives o&rsquo; Gorbals and district, it micht be a&rsquo; richt, for that&rsquo;s
      the place I belang to; and if a&rsquo; the auld natives cam&rsquo; to a Gorbals swaree
      I micht get some o&rsquo; the money some o&rsquo; them&rsquo;s owin&rsquo; me. But Clachnacudden!&mdash;I
      never saw the place; I aye thocht it was jist yin o&rsquo; thae comic names they
      put on the labels o&rsquo; the whisky bottles to mak&rsquo; them look fancy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; believ&rsquo;t, but Macrae, bein&rsquo; Hielan&rsquo; and no&rsquo; haein richt
      English, was that angry for me sayin&rsquo; that aboot Clachnacudden, that he
      was nearly breakin&rsquo; the engagement wi&rsquo; Jinnet&rsquo;s niece, and I had to tak&rsquo; 
      the tickets at the hinder-end jist for peace&rsquo; sake. Jinnet said it was a
      bonny-like thing spilin&rsquo; Sarah&rsquo;s chances for the sake o&rsquo; a shillin&rsquo; or
      twa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the wye I was wi&rsquo; the Clachnacudden chats. Dae ye no&rsquo; feel the
      smell o&rsquo; peat-reek aff me? If it wasna that my feet were flet I could gie
      ye the Hielan&rsquo; Fling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But thae natives&rsquo; reunions in Gleska&rsquo;s no&rsquo; whit they used to be. They&rsquo;re
      gettin&rsquo; far ower genteel. It&rsquo;ll soon be comin&rsquo; to&rsquo;t that ye&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; can
      gang to ony o&rsquo; them unless ye have a gold watch and chain, a dress suit,
      and £10 in the Savin&rsquo;s Bank. It used to be in the auld days when I went to
      natives&rsquo; gatherin&rsquo;s for fun, and no&rsquo; to please the nicht polis, that they
      were ca&rsquo;d a swaree and ball, and the ticket was four-and-six for yoursel&rsquo; 
      and your pairtner. If ye didna get the worth o&rsquo; your money there was
      something wrang wi&rsquo; your stomach, or ye werena very smert. Mony a yin I&rsquo;ve
      bin at, either in the wye o&rsquo; tred, or because some o&rsquo; Jinnet&rsquo;s Hielan&rsquo; 
      kizzens cam&rsquo; up to the hoose in their kilts to sell us tickets. There was
      nae dress suits nor fal-lals aboot a reunion in thae days; ye jist put on
      your Sunday claes and some scent on your hanky, wi&rsquo; a dram in your pocket
      (if ye werena in the committee), turned up the feet o&rsquo; your breeks, and
      walked doon to the hall in the extra-wide welt shoes ye were gaun to dance
      in. Your lass&mdash;or your wife, if it was your wife&mdash;sat up the
      nicht before, washin&rsquo; her white shawl and sewin&rsquo; frillin&rsquo; on the neck o&rsquo; 
      her guid frock, and a&rsquo; the expense ye had wi&rsquo; her if ye werena merried to
      her was that ye had to buy her a pair o&rsquo; white shammy leather gloves, size
      seeven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A&rsquo; the auld folk frae Clachnacudden in Gleska were at thae swarees, as
      weel as a&rsquo; the young folk. Ye were packed in your sates like red herrin&rsquo; 
      in a barrel, and on every hand ye heard folk tearin&rsquo; the tartan and
      misca&rsquo;in&rsquo; somebody at hame in Clachnacudden. The natives wi&rsquo; the dress
      suits that had got on awfu&rsquo; weel in Gleska at the speerit tred or keepin&rsquo; 
      banks, sat as dour as onything on the pletform lettin&rsquo; on they couldna
      speak the tartan. Ithers o&rsquo; them&mdash;that had the richt kind o&rsquo; legs
      for&rsquo;t&mdash;wad hae on the kilts, wi&rsquo; a white goat-skin sporran the size
      o&rsquo; a door-bass hung doon to their knees foment them, haudin&rsquo; in their
      breaths in case the minister wad smell drink aff them, and tryin&rsquo; to feel
      like Rob Roy or Roderick Dhu.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In thae days they started oot wi&rsquo; giein&rsquo; ye tea and a poke o&rsquo; fancy breid&mdash;penny
      things like London buns and fruit-cakes; and between the speeches oranges
      were passed roond, and wee roond hard sweeties, fine for pappin&rsquo; at the
      folk in front. Ye aye made a guid tea o&rsquo;t, the same as if&rsquo; ye never saw
      tea in your life afore, and preferred it weel biled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the tea was bye and the boys were blawin&rsquo; as much breath as they had
      left into the empty pokes, and bangin&rsquo; them aff like cannons, the chairman
      wad stand up on the pletform and make a speech aboot Clachnacudden. I used
      to ken that speech by hert; it was the same yin for a&rsquo; the natives&rsquo; 
      reunions. He said that Clachnacudden was the bonniest place ever onybody
      clapped eyes on. That the Clachnacudden men, were notorious a&rsquo; ower the
      world for their honesty and push, and aye got on like onything if they
      were tryin&rsquo;, and didna tak&rsquo; to the drink; and that the Clachnacuddem
      lassies were that braw, and nice, and smert, they were lookit up to every
      place they went. When he said that the natives o&rsquo; Clachnacudden kent fine
      it was the God&rsquo;s truth he was tellin&rsquo; them, they got on their feet and
      waved their hankies and cheered for ten meenutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Havin&rsquo; taken a drink o&rsquo; watter frae the caraffe at his side&mdash;efter
      makin&rsquo; a mistake and tryin&rsquo; to blaw the froth aff the tumbler&mdash;the
      chairman then begood generally to say that Gleska was a gey cauld, sooty,
      dirty, wicked place for onybody to hae to live in that had been born in
      the bonny wee glens, and the hulls, and hedges, and things aboot
      Clachnacudden, but still
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &lsquo;Their herts were true, their herts were Hielan&rsquo;,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And they in dreams beheld the Hebrides.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      At that ye wad see the hale o&rsquo; the Clachnacudden folk puttin&rsquo; whit was
      left o&rsquo; their pastry in their pouches and haudin&rsquo; their hankies wi&rsquo; baith
      hands to their e&rsquo;en to kep the tears frae rinnin&rsquo; on their guid waistcoats
      or their silk weddin&rsquo;-goons. And the droll thing was that for a&rsquo; they
      misca&rsquo;d Gleska, and grat aboot Clachnacudden, ye couldna get yin o&rsquo; them
      to gang back to Clachnacudden if ye pyed the train ticket and guaranteed a
      pension o&rsquo; a pound a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clachnacudden bein&rsquo; Hielan&rsquo;, they aye started the music efter the
      chairman&rsquo;s speech wi&rsquo; a sang frae Harry Linn ca&rsquo;d &lsquo;Jock Macraw, the
      Fattest Man in the Forty-Twa,&rsquo; or some ither sang that kind o&rsquo; codded
      themsel&rsquo;s. Then the minister made a comic speech wi&rsquo; jokes in&rsquo;t, and tried
      to look as game as onything; and the folk frae Clachnacudden leaned forrit
      on their sates and asked the wifes in front if they had mind when his
      mither used to work in the tawtie field. &lsquo;Fancy him a minister!&rsquo; says
      they, &lsquo;and tryin&rsquo; to be comic, wi&rsquo; his mither jist yin o&rsquo; the
      Mac-Taggarts!&rsquo; A&rsquo; the time the puir minister was thinkin&rsquo; he was daein&rsquo; 
      fine, and wonderin&rsquo; if &lsquo;The Oban Times&rsquo; was takin&rsquo; doon a&rsquo; his speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then a lot o&rsquo; nyafs in the back sates aye began to heave
      orange-peelin&rsquo;s at folk that was daein&rsquo; them nae hairm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Efter the swaree was ower, the weemen went into the ladies&rsquo; room to tak&rsquo; 
      aff their galoshes, and tak&rsquo; the preens oot o&rsquo; their trains, and the men
      went ower to the Duke o&rsquo; Wellington Bar, rinnin&rsquo; like onything, for it was
      nearly eleeven o&rsquo;clock. The folk the hall belanged to started to tak&rsquo; oot
      the sates for the dancin&rsquo;, and sweep the corks aff the floor; and at
      eleeven prompt the Grand Merch started. Whiles they had Adams&rsquo;s or Ilfs
      band, and whiles they jist had Fitzgerald, the fiddler that used to play
      on the Lochgoilhead boat. It didna maitter, for a&rsquo; the Clachnacudden folk
      were fine strong dancers, and could dance to onything. Man! I aye liked
      the Grand Merch. The man wi&rsquo; the reddest kilts aye started it at the
      Clachnacudden, and when the Grand Merch got a&rsquo; fankled, they jist started
      &lsquo;Triumph,&rsquo; and did the best they could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was in the grand auld days afore they got genteel. Nooadays, as I&rsquo;m
      tellin&rsquo; ye, it&rsquo;s a&rsquo; conversashions, and they work aff their speeches on ye
      wi&rsquo; no tea at a&rsquo; and no pokes o&rsquo; pastry, nor naething. Ye&rsquo;re no use unless
      ye hae the lend o&rsquo; a dress suit, and your pairtner has to &lsquo;hae pipe-clyed
      shoon, a muslin frock no&rsquo; richt hooked at the neck, her hair put up at
      Bamber&rsquo;s, and a cab to tak&rsquo; her hame in. It&rsquo;s naething but the waltzin&rsquo;.
      I&rsquo;m prood to say I never waltzed in a&rsquo; my born days, though they say I
      have the richt kind o&rsquo; feet for&rsquo;t, me bein&rsquo; so lang at the waitin&rsquo;. And a&rsquo; 
      they auld classic dances, like La-va and the Guaracha Waltz and Circassian
      Circle&rsquo;s oot o&rsquo; date \ I havena even seen Petronella for mony a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the music&rsquo;s a&rsquo; spiled; it&rsquo;s a&rsquo; fancy music they hae noo, wi&rsquo; nae tune
      ye can sing to&rsquo;t as ye gang up the back or doon the middle. Ye&rsquo;ll see them
      yonder wi&rsquo; their piano, three fiddles, and a cornet. If I was gaun to hae
      a cornet I wad hae a cornet and no&rsquo; a brass feenisher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; see ony o&rsquo; the dacent auld Clachnacudden folk at their modern
      reunions; the puir sowls has to bide at hame and gang to their beds early
      that they may get up in time to mak&rsquo; a cup o&rsquo; tea for their dochters that
      was at the conversashion. No; Jinnet and me&rsquo;s no&rsquo; keen on Clachnacudden or
      onything o&rsquo; the kind nooa-days: we wad faur sooner stay at hame and read
      &lsquo;The Weekly Mail.&rsquo;&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XVIII MARY ANN
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> see frae &lsquo;The
      News,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Erchie, &ldquo;that Mary Ann&rsquo;s no&rsquo; gaun to see her kizzen on her
      nicht oot the noo, but has the kitchen table cleared for action wi&rsquo; a
      penny bottle o&rsquo; Perth ink and a quire o&rsquo; paper to write letters to the
      editor, telling him and his readers that the country doesna ken her value.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If ye&rsquo;re in the habit o&rsquo; tryin&rsquo; to keep a general, ye canna be shair but
      at this very meenute she&rsquo;s doon the stair, wi&rsquo; her sleeves rowed up and
      her fingers a&rsquo; Perth Blue Black, paintin&rsquo; your wife&rsquo;s photograph as a
      slave-driver, and givin&rsquo; your hoose a character that would mak&rsquo; ye lose
      your nicht&rsquo;s sleep if ye kent it. Faith, it&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; to it!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The servant problem is the only ane that&rsquo;s railly o&rsquo; ony interest to the
      country, as far as I can mak&rsquo; oot frae hearin&rsquo; things when I&rsquo;m either
      beadlin&rsquo;, or waitin&rsquo; at waddin&rsquo;-breakfasts. Twa women canna put their
      heads thegither ower a cup o&rsquo; tea withoot gaun ower a list o&rsquo; a&rsquo; the
      lassies they&rsquo;ve had since last November; and the notion ye get is that
      they change frae place to place that often they must hae motor cairrages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary Ann sails in with her kist and a fine character frae her last place
      on Monday at 8 p.m., and aboot ten minutes efter that she&rsquo;s on the road
      again. She is the greatest traveller o&rsquo; the age; it is estimated by them
      that kens aboot thae things, that the average domestic, if she keeps her
      health and gets ony chance at a&rsquo;, gangs 15,000 miles every three years
      shifting her situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the age of the lairge-built, agile, country girl; no ither kind can
      stand the strain o&rsquo; humpin&rsquo; kists up and doon area stairs. An aluminium
      kist that when packed weighs only fifteen pounds has been invented
      specially for the &lsquo;strong and willing general, early riser, no washin&rsquo;,
      fond o&rsquo; weans&rsquo;; but in spite o&rsquo; that, she canna get ower mair nor 250 to
      263 different situations in the year.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Hielan&rsquo;s is the peculiar home o&rsquo; the maist successful domestic
      servants, though a very gude strain o&rsquo; them is said to come frae Ayrshire
      and roon&rsquo; aboot Slamannan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are catched young, carefully clipped, curry-combed and shod, and
      shipped to Gleska at the beginnin&rsquo; o&rsquo; the winter, wi&rsquo; fine characters frae
      the U.F. minister. On the day they start their first situation they&rsquo;re
      generals, that say &lsquo;Whit is&rsquo;t?&rsquo; quite angry, at the door to folk that come
      to their mistress&rsquo;s efternoon teas; on the Wednesday they&rsquo;re wanting their
      wages up; and on the Thursday they start in anither place as experienced
      hoose-and table-maids. At least, that&rsquo;s whit I gaither frae overhearin&rsquo; 
      the ladies: we have nae servant in oor hoose,&mdash;Jinnet does everything
      hersel&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Mary Ann&rsquo;s no&rsquo; packin&rsquo; her kist, or haein&rsquo; confabs wi&rsquo; the butcher,
      or trimmin&rsquo; a frock for the Clachnacudden natives&rsquo; swarree and ball, she&rsquo;s
      lookin&rsquo; the papers to see the rate o&rsquo; servants&rsquo; wages in Kimberley, near
      whaur the wars were. Some day she&rsquo;s gaun to Kimberley, or Australia, or
      ony ither foreign pairt, whaur intelligent cooks get the wages o&rsquo; Cabinet
      Ministers, and can get mairrit jist as easy&rsquo;s onything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the fine auld times servant lassies used to bide wi&rsquo; ye till they were
      that auld and frail ye had to have somebody sittin&rsquo; up wi&rsquo; them at nicht.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yince they got a fit in yer hoose ye couldna get quat o&rsquo; them: they
      fastened their kists to the floor wi&rsquo; big screw-nails, and wad scarcely go
      oot the length o&rsquo; the kirk for fear ye wad shut up the hoose and rin awa&rsquo; 
      and leave them. As for the wages they got, they were that sma&rsquo;, folks used
      to toss up a bawbee to see whether they wad keep a servant or a canary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But nooadays a man that&rsquo;s in the habit o&rsquo; payin&rsquo; ony heed to the servant
      lassies that opens the door for him or hands him his letters, thinks it&rsquo;s
      a magic-lantern show he&rsquo;s at, wi&rsquo; a new picture every twa seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesna see his wife except on the Sundays, for a&rsquo; the ither days o&rsquo; 
      the week she&rsquo;s cyclin&rsquo; roond the registries wi&rsquo; five pounds o&rsquo; change in
      silver, payin&rsquo; fees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Hoose-tablemaid, ma&rsquo;am? Certainly, ma&rsquo;am; we&rsquo;ll see whit we can dae for
      ye between noo and the next Gleska Exhibeetion,&rsquo; says the registry, rakin&rsquo; 
      in the half-croons as hard&rsquo;s she can.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When there&rsquo; a rumour gets aboot Dowanhill that a servant lass, oot o&rsquo; a
      situation, was seen the week afore last, hundreds o&rsquo; ladies mak&rsquo; for the
      registries, and besiege them in the hope o&rsquo; catchin&rsquo; her; and of late, I&rsquo;m
      tellt they&rsquo;re engagin&rsquo; trained detectives for trackin&rsquo; plain cooks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Domestic service is the only profession in Europe the day whaur the
      supply&rsquo;s less than the demand, and if I had twa or three boys ready to
      gang oot and work for themselves, I wad sooner mak&rsquo; them into
      scullery-maids than apprentice them wi&rsquo; an electrical engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the last ten years wha ever heard o&rsquo; a servant lassie oot o&rsquo; a
      situation ony langer than the time she took to rin frae ae hoose to
      anither, if she had the richt number of hands and een?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She disna need to gang ony where lookin&rsquo; for a place; the sleuth-hounds
      o&rsquo; Dowanhill track her to her lair as soon as she&rsquo;s landed at the
      Broomielaw or Buchanan Street Station, and mak&rsquo; a grab at her afore she
      learns enough o&rsquo; the language to ask her wye to a registry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A new servant in a hoose is like a Field Marshal back frae the front,&mdash;she&rsquo;s
      trated wi&rsquo; sae muckle deference. Ye daurna mak&rsquo; a noise through the day
      for fear it&rsquo;ll spoil her sleep. Ye pit on the fire for her in the mornin&rsquo;,
      and brush her golfin&rsquo; buits afore ye start for the office. Ye pay sixpence
      a day o&rsquo; car fares for her to go and see her kizzens in case she&rsquo;s
      wearyin&rsquo;, puir thing! And if &lsquo;Rob Roy&rsquo;s&rsquo; on at the theatre ye&rsquo;ll be as
      weel to let her know and gie her tickets for it, or she&rsquo;ll gie notice when
      she reads the creeticism in the paper and finds oot she missed it. Mair
      nor a dizzen societies have been started for giving medals and rewards to
      servant lassies that have been a lang lang while in the ae situation;
      they&rsquo;re worked oh a graduated scale:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hoosemaids, in one situation two months&mdash;Bronze medal of the Society
      and 30s. Generals, three months&mdash;Silver medal and fountain pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plain cook, six months&mdash;Gold medal, £5, and gramophone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whit the country wants is the municeepilisation o&rsquo; domestic service. The
      better h&rsquo;oosin&rsquo; o&rsquo; the poor&rsquo;s a thing that there&rsquo;s nae hurry for. Plain
      cooks and general servants that ken the difference between a cake o&rsquo; black
      lead and a scrubbing-brush are a communal needcessity; they can nae mair
      be done withoot than gas, water, skoosh cars, or the telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Corporations should import and train Mary Anns in bulk, gie them a
      nate uniform and thirty shillin&rsquo;s a week, and hire them oot &lsquo;oorly, daily,
      weekly, or monthy, as required, reserving for them a&rsquo; the rights and
      privileges that belong to them, wi&rsquo; limitation o&rsquo; workin&rsquo; &lsquo;oors, strick
      definition o&rsquo; duties, stipulated nichts oot, and faceelities for
      followers. Look at the polis. Ye can depend on gettin&rsquo; a polisman nine
      times oot o&rsquo; ten if ye want him; a lassie to gang oot wi&rsquo; the pramlater,
      or a hoose-tablemaid, should be jist as easy got by every ratepayer when
      wanted, and that&rsquo;s only to be secured by the Corporations takin&rsquo; the
      domestic service into their ain haunds.&rdquo;

      XIX DUFFY&rsquo;S, WEDDING
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> did not see
      Erchie during the New-Year holidays, and so our greetings on Saturday
      night when I found him firing up the church furnace had quite a festive
      cheerfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have you been for the past week?&rdquo; I asked him. &ldquo;It looks bad for a
      beadle to be conspicuous by his absence at this season of the year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If ye had been whaur ye ocht to hae been, and that was in the kirk, last
      Sunday, ye wad hae found me at my place,&rdquo; said Erchie. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a bit
      bride&rsquo;s-cake,&rdquo; he went on, taking a little packet from his pocket. &ldquo;The
      rale stuff! Put that below your heid at nicht and ye&rsquo;ll dream aboot the
      yin that&rsquo;s gaun to mairry ye. It&rsquo;s a sure tip, for I&rsquo;ve kent them that
      tried it, and escaped in time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took the wedding-cake. To dream of the one I want to marry is the desire
      of my days&mdash;though, indeed, I don&rsquo;t need any wedding-cake below my
      pillow for such a purpose. &ldquo;And who&rsquo;s wedding does this&mdash;this deadly
      comestible&mdash;come from, Erchie?&rdquo; I asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wha&rsquo;s wad it be but Duffy&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Erchie. &ldquo;&lsquo;At 5896 Braid Street, on the
      31st, by the Rev. J. Macauslane, Elizabeth M&rsquo;Niven Jardine to James K.
      Duffy, coal merchant.&rsquo; Duffy&rsquo;s done for again; ye&rsquo;ll can see him noo
      hurryin&rsquo; hame for his tea when his work&rsquo;s bye and feared ony o&rsquo; the
      regular customers o&rsquo; the Mull o&rsquo; Kintyre Vaults&rsquo;ll stop him on the road
      and ask him in for something. His wife&rsquo;s takin&rsquo; him roond wi&rsquo; a collar on,
      and showin&rsquo; him aff among a&rsquo; her freen&rsquo;s and the ither weemen she wants to
      vex, and she&rsquo;s learning him to ca&rsquo; her &lsquo;Mrs D.&rsquo; when they&rsquo;re in company.
      He wasna twa days at his work efter the thing happened when she made him
      stop cryin&rsquo; his ain coals and leave yin o&rsquo; his men to dae&rsquo;t, though
      there&rsquo;s no&rsquo; twa o&rsquo; them put thegither has the voice o&rsquo; Duffy. I wadna
      wonder if his tred fell aff on accoont o&rsquo;t, and it&rsquo;s tellin&rsquo; on his
      health. &lsquo;She says it&rsquo;s no&rsquo; genteel for me to be cryin&rsquo; my ain coals,&rsquo; he
      says to me; &lsquo;but I think it&rsquo;s jist pride on her pairt, jist pride. Whit
      hairm does it dae onybody for me to gie a wee bit roar noo and then if
      it&rsquo;s gaun to help business?&rsquo; I heard him tryin&rsquo; to sing &lsquo;Dark Lochnagar&rsquo; 
      on Friday nicht in his ain hoose, and it wad vex ye to listen, for when he
      was trampin&rsquo; time wi&rsquo; his feet ye could hardly hear his voice, it was that
      much failed. &lsquo;Duffy,&rsquo; I says till him, takin&rsquo; him aside, &lsquo;never you mind
      the mistress, but go up a close noo and then and gie a roar to keep your
      voice in trim withoot lettin&rsquo; on to her ony-thing aboot it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Duffy was mairried on Hogmanay Nicht, and we were a&rsquo; there&mdash;Jirinet
      and me, and her niece Sarah, and Macrae the nicht polis, and a companion
      o&rsquo; Macrae&rsquo;s frae Ardentinny, that had his pipes wi&rsquo; him to play on, but
      never got them tuned. It was a grand ploy, and the man frae Ardentinny
      fell among his pipes comin&rsquo; doon the stair in the mornin&rsquo;. &lsquo;Ye had faur
      ower much drink,&rsquo; I tellt him, takin&rsquo; him oot frae amang the drones and
      ribbons and things. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m shair ye&rsquo;ve drunk a hale bottle.&rsquo; &lsquo;Whit&rsquo;s a
      bottle o&rsquo; whusky among wan?&rsquo; says he. If it wasna for him it wad hae been
      a rale nice, genteel mairrage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Duffy had on a surtoo coat, and looked for, a&rsquo; the warld like Macmillan,
      the undertaker, on a chape job. He got the lend o&rsquo; the surtoo frae yin o&rsquo; 
      the men aboot the Zoo, and he was aye tryin&rsquo; to put his haunds in the
      ootside pooches and them no&rsquo; there. &lsquo;Oh, Erchie,&rsquo; he says to me, &lsquo;I wish I
      had on my jaicket again, this is no&rsquo; canny. They&rsquo;ll a&rsquo; be lookin&rsquo; at my
      haunds.&rsquo; &lsquo;No, nor yer feet,&rsquo; I tellt him; &lsquo;they&rsquo;ll be ower busy keepin&rsquo; 
      their e&rsquo;e on whit they&rsquo;re gaun to get to eat.&rsquo; &lsquo;If ye only kent it,&rsquo; says
      he, &lsquo;my feet&rsquo;s a torment to me, for my buits is far ower sma&rsquo;.&rsquo; And I
      could see the puir sowl sweatin&rsquo; wi&rsquo; the agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bride looked fine. Jinnet nearly grat when she saw her comin&rsquo; in, and
      said it minded her o&rsquo; hersel&rsquo; the day she was mairried. &lsquo;Ye&rsquo;re just
      haverin&rsquo;,&rsquo; I tellt her, gey snappy. &lsquo;She couldna look as nice as you did
      that day if she was hung wi&rsquo; jewels.&rsquo; But I&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; say Leezie wasna nice
      enough&mdash;a fine, big, sonsy, smert lass, wi&rsquo; her face as glossy as
      onything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the operation was by, and the minister had gane awa&rsquo; hame, us
      pressin&rsquo; him like onything to wait a while langer, and almost breakin&rsquo; his
      airms wi&rsquo; jammin&rsquo; his top-coat on him fast in case he micht change his
      mind, we a&rsquo; sat down to a high tea that wad dae credit to F. &amp; F.&lsquo;s.
      If there was wan hen yonder there was haulf a dizzen, for the bride had a
      hale lot o&rsquo; country freen&rsquo;s, and this is the time o&rsquo; the year the hens is
      no&rsquo; layin&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There were thirty-five folk sat doon in Duffy&rsquo;s hoose that nicht, no&rsquo; 
      coontin&rsquo; a wheen o&rsquo; the neighbours that stood in the lobby and took their
      chance o&rsquo; whit was passin&rsquo; frae the kitchen. Duffy hadna richt started
      carvin&rsquo; the No. 6 hen when a messenger cam&rsquo; to the door to ask for the
      surtoo coat, because the man in the Zoo had his job changed for that nicht
      and found he needed the coat for his work; so Duffy was quite gled to get
      rid of it, and put on his Sunday jaicket. &lsquo;Ask him if he wadna like a wee
      lend o&rsquo; my new tight boots,&rsquo; he says to the messenger frae the Zoo; &lsquo;if he
      does, come back as fast&rsquo;s ye can for them, and I&rsquo;ll pay the cab.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Efter the high tea was by, the Ardentinny man never asked onybody&rsquo;s
      leave, but began to tune his pipes, stoppin&rsquo; every twa or three meenutes
      to bounce aboot the player he was, and that his name was M&rsquo;Kay&mdash;yin
      o&rsquo; the auld clan M&rsquo;Kays. Macrae, the nicht polis, was awfu&rsquo; chawed that he
      brocht him there at a&rsquo;. Ye couldna hear yersel&rsquo; speakin&rsquo; for the tunin&rsquo; o&rsquo; 
      the pipes, and they werena nearly half ready for playin&rsquo; on when the
      bride&rsquo;s mither took the liberty o&rsquo; stoppin&rsquo; him for a wee till we wad get
      a sang frae somebody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;James&rsquo;ll sing,&rsquo; says the bride, lookin&rsquo; as prood&rsquo;s ye like at her new
      man. &lsquo;Will ye no&rsquo; obleege the company wi&rsquo; &ldquo;Dark Lochnagar&rdquo;?&rsquo; &ldquo;&lsquo;I wad be
      only too willin&rsquo;,&rsquo; he tellt her, &lsquo;if I had on my ither boots and hadna ett
      thon last cookie.&rsquo; But we got him to sing &lsquo;Dark Lochnagar&rsquo; a&rsquo; richt. In
      the middle o&rsquo;t the man frae Ardentinny said if Duffy wad haud on a wee he
      wad accompany him on the pipes, and he started to tune them again, but
      Macrae stopped him by puttin&rsquo; corks in his drones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jinnet sang the &lsquo;Auld Hoose.&rsquo; Man! I was prood o&rsquo; her. Yon&rsquo;s the smertest
      wumman in Gleska. The Rale Oreeginal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you yourself sing, Erchie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not me! I&rsquo;m comic enough withoot that. A flet fit and a warm hert, but
      timmer in the tune. Forbye, I was too busy keepin&rsquo; doon the man frae
      Ardentinny. He was determined to hae them pipes o&rsquo; his tuned if it took
      him a&rsquo; nicht. I tried to get him to gang oot into the back-coort to screw
      them up, but he aye said they were nearly ready noo, they wadna tak&rsquo; him
      ten meenutes, and he kept screechin&rsquo; awa&rsquo; at them. It was fair
      reediculous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last the bride&rsquo;s mither got him put into the kitchen, and was clearin&rsquo; 
      the room for a dance. Duffy was very red in the face, and refused to rise
      frae the table. &lsquo;Whit&rsquo;s the use o&rsquo; dancin&rsquo;?&rsquo; says he; &lsquo;are we no&rsquo; daein&rsquo; 
      fine the way we are?&rsquo; And then it was found oot he had slipped his tight
      boots aff him under the table, and was sittin&rsquo; there as joco as ye like in
      his stockin&rsquo; soles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young yins were dancin&rsquo; in the room to the playin&rsquo; o&rsquo; a whustle, and
      the rest o&rsquo; us were smokin&rsquo; oot on the stair-heid, when the man frae
      Ardentinny cam fleein&rsquo; oot wi&rsquo; his bagpipes still gaspin&rsquo;. He said it was
      an insult to him to start dancin&rsquo; to a penny whustle and him there ready
      to play if he could only get his pipes tuned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Never you heed, Mac,&rsquo; says I; &lsquo;ye&rsquo;ll hae a chance at Macrae&rsquo;s waddin&rsquo; if
      ye can get the pipes tuned afore then; he&rsquo;s engaged to oor Sarah.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was that gled when the cat-wutted cratur fell amang his pipes gaun doon
      the stair in the mornin&rsquo;; it served him richt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where did Duffy and his bride spend their honeymoon, Erchie?&rdquo; I
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They took the skoosh car oot to Paisley; that was a&rsquo; their honeymoon.&rdquo;

      XX ON CORPORAL PUNISHMENT
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>n this question of
      corporal punishment in the schools, Erchie,&rdquo; I said to my old friend,
      &ldquo;what are your views? I&rsquo;ve no doubt you&rsquo;re dead against any alteration on
      use and wont.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whiles,&rdquo;&rsquo; said Erchie; &ldquo;whiles! I buy the paper ae day, and when I read
      the wye brutal and ignorant schoolmaisters abuse their poseetion, I feel
      that angry I could fling bricks at the windows o&rsquo; a&rsquo; the schools I pass on
      the wye to my wark; but the next day when I read whit perfect wee deevils
      a&rsquo; the weans is nooadays, and hoo they&rsquo;ll a&rsquo; turn oot a-disgrace to their
      faithers and mithers if they divna get a beltin&rsquo; twice a-day, I&rsquo;m sair
      tempted to gae ower to my guid-dochter&rsquo;s in the Calton and tak&rsquo; a
      razor-strop to wee Alick afore he gangs to his bed, jist in case he&rsquo;s
      bein&rsquo; negleckit. That&rsquo;s the warst o the newspapers; they&rsquo;re aye giein&rsquo; ye
      the differen&rsquo; sets o&rsquo;t, and ye read sae much on the ae side and then the
      ither that ye&rsquo;re fair bate to mak&rsquo; up your mind. My ain puir auld faither&mdash;peace
      be wi&rsquo; him!&mdash;didna seem to be muckle fashed wi&rsquo; the different sets
      o&rsquo;t in the newspapers; he made up his mind awfu&rsquo; fast, and gied ye his
      fit-rule ower the back o&rsquo; the fingers afore ye could gie your wee brither
      a clip on the nose for clypin&rsquo; on ye. They may abolish corporal punishment
      in the Gleska schools, but they&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; pit an end to&rsquo;t in hooses whaur the
      faither&rsquo;s a plumber and aye has a fit-rule stuck doon the outside seam o&rsquo; 
      his breeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah yes! Erchie, but these paternal ebullitions of ill-temper&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ill-temper or no&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Erchie, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a&rsquo; in the scheme o&rsquo; nature, and an
      angry man&rsquo;s jist as much the weepon o&rsquo; nature as a thunderbolt is, or a
      lichted caundle lookin&rsquo; for an escape o&rsquo; gas. If ye dinna get your licks
      in the school for bein&rsquo; late in the mornin&rsquo;, ye&rsquo;ll get fined an awfu&rsquo; lot
      o&rsquo; times for sleepin&rsquo; in when ye&rsquo;re auld enough to work in Dubs&rsquo;s; so the
      thing&rsquo;s as braid as it&rsquo;s wide, as the Hielan&rsquo;man said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you seem to think a fit of anger is essential to paternal
      punishment, Erchie? That&rsquo;s surely contrary to all sober conclusions?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sober conclusions hae naethin&rsquo; to dae wi&rsquo; skelpin&rsquo; weans, as I ken fine
      that brocht up ten o&rsquo; a family and nearly a&rsquo; that&rsquo;s spared o&rsquo; them daein&rsquo; 
      weel for themsel&rsquo;s. The auld Doctor in oor kirk talks aboot love and
      chastisement, but in my experience human nature wad be a&rsquo; to bleezes lang
      afore this if faithers and mithers didna whiles lose their tempers and gie
      their weans whit they deserved. If you&rsquo;re the kind o&rsquo; man that could
      thresh a puir wee smout o&rsquo; a laddie in cauld bluid, I&rsquo;m no&rsquo;, and I canna
      help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did you thrash your ten much, Erchie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I asked, with a doubt as to that essential ill-temper in his case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That has naethin&rsquo; to dae wi&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said he, quickly. &ldquo;My private
      disinclination to hae the wee smouts greetin&rsquo; disna affect the point at
      a&rsquo;. If oor yins needed it, I went oot for a daunder and left the job to
      Jinnet. A woman&rsquo;s aye the best hand at it, as I ken by my aunty Chirsty.
      When she had the threshin&rsquo; o&rsquo;, me, she aye gied me tuppence efter it was
      done if I grat awfu&rsquo; sair, and I took guid care I never went wantin&rsquo; money
      in thae days. I was only vexed she couldna thresh me threepence-worth the
      time the shows were roond oor wye, and mony&rsquo;s the time I worked for&rsquo;t.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the papers mak&rsquo; me wonder whether corporal punishment&rsquo;s guid for the
      young or no&rsquo;, I jist tak&rsquo; a look at mysel&rsquo; in Jinnet&rsquo;s new wardrobe
      looking-gless, and, except for the flet feet&mdash;me bein&rsquo; a waiter&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t see muckle wrang wi&rsquo; Erchie MacPherson, and the Lord kens there was
      nae slackness o&rsquo; corporal punishment in his days, though then it was
      simply ca&rsquo;d a leatherin&rsquo;. My mither threshed me because it wadna gae wrang
      onywye&mdash;if I wasna need&rsquo;nt the noo I wad be need&rsquo;nt some ither time;
      and my faither threshed me because there was a hard knot in the laces o&rsquo; 
      his boots, and he couldna lowse&rsquo;t. It didna dae me ony hairm, because I
      ken&rsquo;t they were fond enough o&rsquo; me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the school we were weel threshed in the winter-time to keep us warm,
      and in the summertime a stirrin&rsquo;-up wi&rsquo; the tawse a&rsquo; roond made up for the
      want o&rsquo; ventilation. If I never learned much else in the school, I got a
      fair grup o&rsquo; nai-tural history, and yin o&rsquo; the tips I got was that a
      horse-hair laid across the loof o&rsquo; the haund&rsquo;ll split a cane or cut the
      fingers aff a tawse, when ye&rsquo;re struck by either the yin or the ither. I
      made twa or three cairt-horses bald-heided at the tail wi&rsquo; my
      experimentin&rsquo;, but somethin&rsquo; aye went wrang; the maister either let fly
      ower sudden, or it was the wrang kind o&rsquo; horse&mdash;at onyrate, I never
      mind o&rsquo; cuttin&rsquo; the cane or the tawse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whiles when I&rsquo;m across at my guid-dochter&rsquo;s, I hear her wee laddie,
      Alick, greetin&rsquo; ower his coonts, and fear&rsquo;t the maister&rsquo;ll cane him
      because they&rsquo;re no&rsquo; richt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;If a cistern wi&rsquo; an inlet pipe twa-and-a-half inches in diameter lets in
      seventy-nine gallons eleeven quarts and seeven pints in twenty-fower and a
      half&rsquo;oors, and an ootlet pipe o&rsquo; three-quarters o&rsquo; an inch diameter
      discharge forty-eight gallons nineteen quarts and five pints in the
      six&rsquo;oors, whit o&rsquo;clock will the cistern be empty if the ootlet pipe hiz a
      big leak in&rsquo;t?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the kind o&rsquo; staggerer puir wee Alick gets thrashed for if he canna
      answer&rsquo;t richt. I couldna dae a coont like that mysel&rsquo;, as shair&rsquo;s death,
      if I was pyed for&rsquo;t, unless I had the cistern aside me, and a len&rsquo; o&rsquo; the
      measures frae the Mull o&rsquo; Kintyre Vaults, and Jinnet wi&rsquo; a lump o&rsquo; chalk
      keepin&rsquo; tally. I&rsquo;m no&rsquo; shair that it&rsquo;s ony guid to thrash wee Alick for
      no&rsquo; can&rsquo; daein&rsquo; a coont o&rsquo; that kind, or for no&rsquo; bein&rsquo; able to spell
      &lsquo;fuchsia,&rsquo; or for no&rsquo; mindin&rsquo; the exact heights o&rsquo; a&rsquo; the principal
      mountains in Asia and Sooth America.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hoo wad ye like it yoursel&rsquo;? Ye canna put mathematics into a callan&rsquo;s
      heid by thrashin&rsquo; him ower the fingers, if he&rsquo;s no&rsquo; made wi&rsquo; the richt
      lump in his heid for mathematics; and if Alick&rsquo;s schoolmaister gaes on
      thinkin&rsquo; he can, I&rsquo;ll gae oot some day to his school and maybe get the
      jyle for&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, Erchie,&rdquo; I protested; &ldquo;you are in quite an inconsistent
      humour to-day; surely Alick&rsquo;s thrashings are all in the scheme of nature.
      If he is not punished now for inability to do that interesting proposition
      in compound proportion, he will be swindled out of part of his just
      payment when paid for bricklaying by the piece when he has taken to the
      trade, and the thing&mdash;once more as the Highlandman said&mdash;is as
      broad as it&rsquo;s wide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nane o&rsquo; my guid-dochter&rsquo;s sons is gaun to tak&rsquo; to treds,&rdquo; said Erchie,
      coldly; &ldquo;they&rsquo;re a&rsquo; gaun to be bankers and electreecians and clerks and
      genteel things o&rsquo; that sort. If I&rsquo;m no&rsquo; consistent aboot, this, it&rsquo;s
      because o&rsquo; whit I tellt ye, that I&rsquo;ve read ower mony o&rsquo; thae letters and
      interviews in the papers, and canna mak&rsquo; up my mind. I ken fine a&rsquo; the
      beltin&rsquo;s I got in the school were for my guid, but&mdash;but&mdash;but
      it&rsquo;s different wi&rsquo; wee Alick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we have all our wee Alicks, Erchie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;re a&rsquo; weel aff,&rdquo; said Erchie, glowing, &ldquo;for yon&rsquo;s the comicalest
      wee trate! The Rale Oreeginal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the teachers don&rsquo;t understand him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the hale p&rsquo;int,&rdquo; said Erchie, agreeably; &ldquo;the teachers never dae.
      They&rsquo;re no&rsquo; pyed for understandin&rsquo; a&rsquo; the wee Alicks: a&rsquo; that can be
      expected for the wages the schoolmaisters get in Gleska is that they&rsquo;ll
      haul the wee cratur by the scruff o&rsquo; the neck through a&rsquo; the standards..
      The schoolmaister and the mither ought to be mair prized and bigger pyed
      than ony ither class in the country, but they&rsquo;re no&rsquo;, and that&rsquo;s the
      reason their jobs are often sae badly filled up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If education was a&rsquo; that folk think it is, there wad lang syne hae been
      nae need for cane nor strap. For mair nor a generation noo, every bairn
      has had to go to the school&mdash;a&rsquo; the parents o&rsquo; a&rsquo; the weans in school
      the noo have had an education themsel&rsquo;s, so that baith at hame and in the
      school the young generation of the present day have sae mony advantages
      ower whit you and I had, they ought to be regular gems o&rsquo; guid behaviour
      and intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I canna see that they&rsquo;re ony better than their grandfaithers were at
      the same age. Except my good-dochter&rsquo;s boy Alick, I think they&rsquo;re a&rsquo; 
      worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A&rsquo; the difference seems to be that they&rsquo;re auld sooner than we were,
      smoke sooner, and swear sooner, and in a hunner wyes need mair leatherin&rsquo; 
      than we did. Education o&rsquo; the heid&rsquo;s no&rsquo; education o&rsquo; the hert, and the
      only thing that comes frae crammin&rsquo; a callant o&rsquo; naiturally bad
      disposeetion with book-learnin&rsquo; is that he&rsquo;s the better trained for
      swindlin&rsquo; his fellow-men when he&rsquo;s auld enough to try his hand at it. I
      wad be awfu&rsquo; prood o&rsquo; every new school that&rsquo;s in Gleska if I didna ken
      that I had to pye a polis tax for&rsquo;t by-and-bye as weel as school tax.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How glad we ought to be, Erchie, that we were born in a more virtuous
      age,&rdquo; I said, and Erchie screwed up his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We werena,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s aye been the same since the start o&rsquo; things.
      I&rsquo;ve jist been sayin&rsquo; to ye whit I mind o&rsquo; hearin&rsquo; my faither say to
      mysel&rsquo;. There&rsquo;ll aye be jist enough rogues in the world to keep guid folk
      like you and me frae gettin&rsquo; awfu&rsquo; sick o&rsquo; each ither.&rdquo;

      XXI THE FOLLIES OF FASHION
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>y old friend has a
      great repugnance to donning new clothes. His wife Jinnet told me once she
      had always to let him get into a new suit, as it were, on the instalment
      system: the first Sunday he reluctantly put on the trousers; the second he
      ventured the trousers and waistcoat; and on the third he courageously went
      forth in the garb complete, after looking out at the close-mouth first to
      see that Duffy or any other ribald and critical acquaintance was not
      looking.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw a tell-tale crease down the front of the old man&rsquo;s legs yesterday.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;New sartorial splendour, Erchie?&rdquo; I said, and pinched him for luck.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got very red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re awfu&rsquo; gleg in the een,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;am I no&rsquo; daein&rsquo; my best to let
      on they&rsquo;re an auld pair cleaned? Blame the wife for&rsquo;t! there&rsquo;s naethin&rsquo; o&rsquo; 
      the la-di-da aboot easy-gaun Erchie. But weemen! claes is their hale
      concern since the day that Adam&rsquo;s wife got the shape o&rsquo; a sark frae the
      deevil, and made if wi&rsquo; a remender o&rsquo; fig-leafs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no much wrang wi&rsquo; Jinnet, but she&rsquo;s far ower pernicketty aboot
      whit her and me puts on, and if she has naething else to brag aboot she&rsquo;ll
      brag I hae aye the best-brushed buits in oor kirk. She took an awfu&rsquo; thraw
      yince at yin o&rsquo; the elders, for she thocht he bate me wi&rsquo; the polish o&rsquo; 
      his buits, and she could hardly sleep ower the heid o&rsquo;t till I tellt her
      they were patent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Och!&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;is that a&rsquo;? Patent&rsquo;s no&rsquo; in the game.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Onything&rsquo;s in the game,&rsquo; says I to her, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s chaper nor heeling and
      soling.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad enough,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;to be hurtin&rsquo; yer knees wi&rsquo; new breeks,
      and haein&rsquo; the folk lookin&rsquo; at ye, but it&rsquo;s a mercy for you and me we&rsquo;re
      no&rsquo; weemen. You and me buys a hat, and as lang&rsquo;s the rim and the rest o&rsquo;t
      stick thegither, it&rsquo;s no&rsquo; that faur oot the fashion: we need to hide
      oorsel&rsquo;s. The only thing I see changes in is collars, and whether it&rsquo;s the
      lying-doon kind or the double-breisted chats, they hack yer neck like
      onything. There&rsquo;s changes in ties, but gie me plain black.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Noo, Jinnet has to hae the shape o&rsquo; her hat shifted every month as
      regular&rsquo;s a penny diary. If it&rsquo;s flet in June, it&rsquo;s cockin&rsquo; up in July;
      and if the bash is on the left side in August, it has to be on the right
      side in September.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Och! but there&rsquo;s no&rsquo; muckle wrang wi&rsquo; Jinnet for a&rsquo; that; she wanted to
      buy me a gold watch-chain last Fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;A gold watch-chain&rsquo;s a nice, snod, bien-lookin&rsquo; thing aboot a man,&rsquo; she
      says, &lsquo;and it&rsquo;s gey usefu&rsquo;.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nor usefu&rsquo;,&rsquo; says I; &lsquo;a watch-chain looks fine on a man, but it&rsquo;s his
      gallowses dae the serious wark.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, Erchie,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;our sex can&rsquo;t escape criticism for its
      eccentricities of costume either. Just fancy our pockets, for instance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re right, there,&rdquo; Erchie agreed; &ldquo;hae I no&rsquo; fifteen pouches mysel&rsquo; 
      when I hae my topcoat on? If I put a tramway ticket into yin&rsquo; o&rsquo; them I
      wadna be able to fin&rsquo; oot which o&rsquo; them it was in for an&rsquo;oor or twa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pockets is a rale divert. Ye canna dae with-oot nine or ten in Gleska if
      ye try yer best. In the country it&rsquo;s different. Doon aboot Yoker, and
      Gargunnock, and Deid Slow and them places, a&rsquo; a man needs in the wye o&rsquo; 
      pouches is twa trooser yins&mdash;yin for each haund when he&rsquo;s leanin&rsquo; 
      against a byre-door wonderin&rsquo; whit job he&rsquo;ll start the morn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot o&rsquo; fancy wee pouches that&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; haud mair nor a
      pawn-ticket aboot a Gleska man&rsquo;s claes, but in the country they dae wi&rsquo; 
      less and dig them deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sae faur as I can see, the pouch is a new-fashioned thing a&rsquo;thegither.
      Look at them auld chaps ye see in pictures wi&rsquo; the galvanised or
      black-leaded airn suits on; if yin o&rsquo; them wanted a pouch he wad need to
      cut it himsel&rsquo; wi&rsquo; a sardine-opener, and then he wad peel a&rsquo; his knuckles
      feelin&rsquo; for his hankey or the price o&rsquo; a pint. I&rsquo;m gled I wisna gaun aboot
      when them galvanised airn suits was the go; it must hae been awfu&rsquo; sair on
      the nails scratchin&rsquo; yersel&rsquo;. Yer claes were made then in a biler-works.
      When ye went for the fit-on, the cutter bashed in the slack bits at the
      back wi&rsquo; a hammer and made it easier for ye under the oxter wi&rsquo; a cauld
      chisel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I want it higher at the neck,&rsquo; says you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Right!&rsquo; says he, quite game, and bangs in twa or three extra rivets. And
      your wife, if ye had yin, had to gie your suits a polish up every Friday
      when she was daein&rsquo; the kitchen grate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the same when the Hielan&rsquo;s was the wye ye read aboot in books, and
      every Hielan&rsquo;-man wore the kilts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was nae pocket in a pair o&rsquo; kilts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daursay that was because the Hielan&rsquo;man never had onything worth while
      to put in a pocket if he had yin. He hung his snuff-mull and his knife and
      fork ootside his claes, and kept his skean-dhu in his stockin&rsquo;. . .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a proof that weemen&rsquo;s no&rsquo; richt ceevilised yet that they can be
      daein&rsquo;, like the men I&rsquo;m speakin&rsquo; aboot, withoot ony pooches. Jinnet tells
      me there&rsquo;s nae pooch in a woman&rsquo;s frock nooadays, because it wad spoil her
      sate on the bicycle. That&rsquo;s the wye ye see weemen gaun aboot wi&rsquo; their
      purses in their haunds, and their bawbees for the skoosh car inside their
      glove, and their bonny wee watches that never gang because they&rsquo;re never
      rowed up, hinging just ony place they&rsquo;ll hook on to ootside their claes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was yince gaun doon to Whiteinch on a Clutha to see a kizzen o&rsquo; the
      wife&rsquo;s, and Jinnet was wi&rsquo; me. Me bein&rsquo; caury-haunded, I got aff by
      mistake at Govan on the wrang side o&rsquo; the river, when Jinnet was crackin&rsquo; 
      awa&rsquo; like a pen-gun wi&rsquo; some auld wife at the sherp end o&rsquo; the boat, and
      she didna see me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh! Erchie!&rsquo; she says when she cam&rsquo; hame, &lsquo;the time I&rsquo;ve put in! I
      thocht ye wis drooned.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And ye hurried hame for the Prudential Insurance book, I suppose?&rsquo; says
      I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;but I made up my mind to hae a pooch o&rsquo; my ain efter
      this, if I merrit again, to haud my ain Clutha fares, and no&rsquo; be lippenin&rsquo; 
      to onybody.&rsquo;&rdquo;

      XXII ERCHIE IN AN ART TEA-ROOM
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> saw you and Duffy
      looking wonderfully smart in Sauchiehall Street on Saturday,&rdquo; I said to
      Erchie one morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man, were we no&rsquo;?&rdquo; replied the old man, with an amused countenance. &ldquo;I
      must tell ye the pant we had. Ye&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; guess where I had Duffy. Him and
      me was in thon new tea-room wi&rsquo; the comic windows. Yin o&rsquo; his horses dee&rsquo;d
      on him, and he was doon the toon liftin&rsquo; the insurance for&rsquo;t. I met him
      comin&rsquo; hame wi&rsquo; his Sunday claes on, and the three pound ten he got for
      the horse. He was that prood he was walkin&rsquo; sae far back on his heels that
      a waff o&rsquo; win&rsquo; wad hae couped him, and whustlin&rsquo; &lsquo;Dark Lochnagar.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Come on in somewhere and hae something,&rsquo; says he, quite joco.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Not me,&rsquo; says I&mdash;&rsquo; I&rsquo;m nane o&rsquo; the kind; a beadle&rsquo;s a public man,
      and he disna ken wha may be lookin&rsquo; at him, but I&rsquo;ll tell ye whit I&rsquo;ll dae
      wi&rsquo; ye&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tak&rsquo; ye into a tea-room.&rsquo; &lsquo;A&rsquo; richt,&rsquo; says Duffy; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
      game for a pie or onything.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I took him like a lamb to the new place. When we came foment it, he
      glowered, and &lsquo;Michty!&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;wha did this?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Miss Cranston,&rsquo; says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Was she tryin&rsquo;?&rsquo; says Duffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;She took baith hands to&rsquo;t,&rsquo; I tellt him. &lsquo;And a gey smert wumman, too,
      if ye ask me.&rsquo; He stood five meenutes afore I could get him in, wi&rsquo; his
      een glued on the fancy doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do ye hae to break yer wey in?&rsquo; says he. &ldquo;&lsquo;No, nor in, I tells him; look
      slippy in case some o&rsquo; yer customers sees ye!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Och! I havena claes for a place o&rsquo; the kind,&rsquo; says he, and his face red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Man!&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;ye&rsquo;ve henned&mdash;that&rsquo;s whit&rsquo;s wrang wi&rsquo; ye: come in
      jist for the pant; naebody &lsquo;ll touch ye, and ye&rsquo;ll can come oot if it&rsquo;s
      sore.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In we goes, Duffy wi&rsquo; his kep aff. He gave the wan look roond him, and
      put his hand in his pooch to feel his money. &lsquo;Mind I have only the three
      flaffers and a half, Erchie,&rsquo; says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;ll cost ye nae mair than the Mull o&rsquo; Kintyre Vaults,&rsquo; I tellt him,
      and we began sclimmin&rsquo; the stairs. Between every rail there was a piece o&rsquo; 
      gless like the bottom o&rsquo; a soda-water bottle, hangin&rsquo; on a wire; Duffy
      touched every yin o&rsquo; them for luck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Whit dae ye think o&rsquo; that, noo?&rsquo; I asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s gey fancy,&rsquo; says Duffy; &lsquo;will we be lang?&rsquo; &ldquo;&lsquo;Ye puir ignorant
      cratur!&rsquo; I says, losin&rsquo; my patience a&rsquo;thegither, &lsquo;ye havena a mind in the
      dietin&rsquo; line above a sate on the trams o&rsquo; a lorry wi&rsquo; a can o&rsquo; soup in
      your hand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may tell ye I was a wee bit put aboot mysel&rsquo;, though I&rsquo;m a waiter by
      tred, and seen mony a dydo in my time. There was naething in the hale
      place was the way I was accustomed to; the very snecks o&rsquo; the doors were
      kind o&rsquo; contrairy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;This way for the threepeny cups and the guid bargains,&rsquo; says I to Duffy,
      and I lands him into whit they ca&rsquo; the Room de Looks. Maybe ye havena seen
      the Room de Looks; it&rsquo;s the colour o&rsquo; a goon Jinnet used to hae afore we
      mairried: there&rsquo;s whit Jinnet ca&rsquo;s insertion on the table-cloths, and wee
      beads stitched a&rsquo; owre the wa&rsquo;s the same as if somebody had done it
      themsel&rsquo;s. The chairs is no&rsquo; like ony ither chairs ever I clapped eyes on,
      but ye could easy guess they were chairs; and a&rsquo; roond the place there&rsquo;s a
      lump o&rsquo; lookin&rsquo;-gless wi&rsquo; purple leeks pented on it every noo and then.
      The gasalier in the middle was the thing that stunned me. It&rsquo;s hung a&rsquo; 
      roond wi&rsquo; hunners o&rsquo; big gless bools, the size o&rsquo; yer nief&mdash;but ye
      don&rsquo;t get pappin&rsquo; onything at them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Duffy could only speak in whispers. &lsquo;My jove!&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;ye&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; get
      smokin&rsquo; here, I&rsquo;ll bate.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Smokin&rsquo;!&rsquo; says I; &lsquo;ye micht as weel talk o&rsquo; gowfin&rsquo;.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I never in a&rsquo; my life saw the like o&rsquo;t afore. This cows a&rsquo;!&rsquo; says he,
      quite nervous and frich-teried lookin&rsquo;.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Och!&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s no&rsquo; your fau&rsquo;t; you didna dae&rsquo;t onyway. Sit doon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a wheen lassies wi&rsquo; white frocks and tippets on for waitresses,
      and every yin o&rsquo; them wi&rsquo; a string of big red beads roond her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ye&rsquo;ll notice, Duffy,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;that though ye canna get ony drink here,
      ye can tak&rsquo; a fine bead onyway,&rsquo; but he didna see my joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chaps me no&rsquo;!&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;Whit did ye say the name o&rsquo; this room was?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The Room de books,&rsquo; I tellt him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;ll likely be the Room de Good Looks,&rsquo; says he, lookin&rsquo; at the
      waitress that cam&rsquo; for oor order. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m for a pie and a bottle o&rsquo; Broon
      Robin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll get naething o&rsquo; the kind. Ye&rsquo;ll jist tak&rsquo; tea, and stretch yer hand
      like a Christian for ony pastry ye want,&rsquo; said I, and Duffy did it like a
      lamb. Oh! I had the better o&rsquo; him; the puir sowl never saw onything fancy
      in his life afore since the time Glenroy&rsquo;s was shut in the New City Road,
      where the Zoo is. It was a rale&rsquo; divert. It was the first time ever he had
      a knife and fork to eat cookies wi&rsquo;, and he thocht his teaspoon was a&rsquo; 
      bashed oot o&rsquo; its richt shape till I tellt him that was whit made it Art.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Art,&rsquo; says he; &lsquo;whit the mischief&rsquo;s Art?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I can easy tell ye whit Art is,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;for it cost me mony a penny.
      When I got mairried, Duffy, haircloth chairs was a&rsquo; the go; the sofas had
      twa ends to them, and you had to hae six books wi&rsquo; different coloured
      batters spread oot on the paurlor table, wi&rsquo; the tap o&rsquo; yer weddin&rsquo;-cake
      under a gless globe in the middle. Wally dugs on the mantelpiece, worsted
      things on the chair-backs, a picture o&rsquo; John Knox ower the kist o&rsquo; 
      drawers, and &lsquo;Heaven Help Our Home&rsquo; under the kitchen clock&mdash;that was
      whit Jinnet and me started wi&rsquo;. There&rsquo;s mony a man in Gleska the day
      buyin&rsquo; hand-done pictures and wearin&rsquo; tile hats to their work that begun
      jist like that. When Art broke oot&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I never took it yet,&rsquo; says Duffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I ken that,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;but it&rsquo;s ragin&rsquo; a&rsquo; ower the place; ye&rsquo;ll be a
      lucky man if ye&rsquo;re no&rsquo; smit wi&rsquo;t cairryin&rsquo; coals up thae new tenements
      they ca&rsquo; mansions, for that&rsquo;s a hotbed o&rsquo; Art. But as I say, when Art
      broke oot, Jinnet took it bad, though she didna ken the name o&rsquo; the
      trouble, and the haircloth chairs had to go, and leather yins got, and the
      sofa wi&rsquo; the twa ends had to be swapped for yin wi&rsquo; an end cut aff and no&rsquo; 
      richt back. The wally dugs, and the worsted things, and the picture o&rsquo; 
      John Knox, were nae langer whit Jinnet ca&rsquo;d the fashion, and something
      else had to tak&rsquo; their place. That was Art: it&rsquo;s a lingerin&rsquo; disease; she
      has the dregs o&rsquo;t yet, and whiles buys shilling things that&rsquo;s nae use for
      ony-thing except for dustin&rsquo;.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh! is that it?&rsquo;says Duffy; &lsquo;I wish I had a pie.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ye&rsquo;ll get a pie then,&rsquo; I tellt him, &lsquo;but ye canna expect it here; a
      pie&rsquo;s no becomin&rsquo; enough for the Room de Looks. Them&rsquo;s no&rsquo; chairs for a
      coalman to sit on eatin&rsquo; pies.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We went doon the stair then, and I edged him into the solid meat
      department. There was a lassie sittin&rsquo; at a desk wi&rsquo; a wheen o&rsquo; different
      coloured bools afore her, and when the waitresses cam&rsquo; to her for an order
      for haricot mutton or roast beef or onything like that frae the kitchen,
      she puts yin o&rsquo; the bools doon a pipe into the kitchen, and the stuff
      comes up wi&rsquo; naething said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Whit dae ye ca&rsquo; that game?&rsquo; asks Duffy, lookin&rsquo; at her pappin&rsquo; doon the
      bools; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s no&rsquo; moshy onywey.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No, nor moshy,&rsquo; I says to him. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s Art. Ye can hae yer pie frae the
      kitchen withoot them yellin&rsquo; doon a pipe for&rsquo;t and lettin&rsquo; a&rsquo; the ither
      customers ken whit ye want.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the pie cam&rsquo; up, it was jist the shape o&rsquo; an ordinary pie, wi&rsquo; nae
      beads nor onything Art aboot it, and Duffy cheered up at that, and said he
      enjoyed his tea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope the refining and elevating influence of Miss Cranston&rsquo;s beautiful
      rooms will have a permanent effect on Duffy&rsquo;s taste,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it will,&rdquo; said Erchie; &ldquo;but we were nae sooner oot than he was
      wonderin&rsquo; where the nearest place wad be for a gless o&rsquo; beer.&rdquo;

      XXIII THE HIDDEN TREASURE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> wish somebody
      would leave me some money,&rdquo; said Jinnet, &ldquo;and the first thing I would dae
      wi&rsquo;t would be to buy ye a new topcoat. That yin&rsquo;s Erchie gettin&rsquo; gey
      shabby, and that glazed I can almaist see my face in the back o&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then ye&rsquo;re weel aff,&rdquo; said Erchie, &ldquo;for there&rsquo;s seldom ye&rsquo;ll see a
      bonnier yin in a better lookin&rsquo;-gless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, ye auld haver!&rdquo; cried Jinnet, pushing him. &ldquo;I wonder ye divna think
      shame to be talkin&rsquo; like a laddie to his first lass; and me jist a done
      auld body! If I could jist get a shape I wad buy a remnant and mak&rsquo; ye a
      topcoat mysel&rsquo;. I could dae&rsquo;t quite easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ken fine that,&rdquo; said her husband, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll bate ye would put the
      buttons on the wrang side, the way ye did wi&rsquo; yon waistcoat. It&rsquo;s a droll
      thing aboot weemen&rsquo;s claes that they aye hae their buttons on
      caurey-handed. It jist lets ye see their contrariness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s a peety ye mairried me,&rdquo; said Jinnet; &ldquo;a contrairy wife must be
      an awfu&rsquo; handfu&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weel, so ye are contrairy,&rdquo; said Erchie firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It tak&rsquo;s twa to be contrairy, jist the same wye as it tak&rsquo;s twa to mak&rsquo; a
      quarrel,&rdquo; said Jinnet, picking some fluff off his sleeve. &ldquo;Whit wye am I
      contrairy I would like to ken?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If ye werena contrairy, ye would be thinkin&rsquo; o&rsquo; buyin&rsquo; something for
      yersel&rsquo; instead o&rsquo; a topcoat for me, and ye&rsquo;re far mair needn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said
      Erchie, and with that a knock came to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s somebody,&rdquo; said Jinnet hastily, &ldquo;put on the kettle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come awa&rsquo; in, Mr Duffy, and you, Mrs Duffy,&rdquo; said Jinnet; &ldquo;we&rsquo;re rale
      gled to see ye, Erchie and me. I was jist puttin&rsquo; on the kettle to mak&rsquo; a
      drap tea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Duffy and his wife came into the cosy light and warmth of the kitchen, and
      sat down. There was an elation in the coalman&rsquo;s eye that could not be
      concealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My jove! I&rsquo;ve news for ye the nicht,&rdquo; said he, taking out his pipe and
      lighting it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s that the bag o&rsquo; coals is up anither bawbee,&rdquo; said Erchie,
      &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nae hurry for&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s no&rsquo; awfu&rsquo; new news that onywye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye needna be aye castin&rsquo; up my tred to me,&rdquo; protested Duffy. &ldquo;Whaur would
      ye be wantin&rsquo; coals?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr MacPherson&rsquo;s quite richt,&rdquo; said Mrs Duffy; &ldquo;everybody kens it&rsquo;s no&rsquo; an
      awfu&rsquo; genteel thing sellin&rsquo; coals, they&rsquo;re that&mdash;that black. I&rsquo;m aye
      at him, Mrs MacPherson, to gie up the ree and the lorries and start a
      eatin&rsquo;-house. I could bake and cook for&rsquo;t fine. Noo that this money&rsquo;s com&rsquo; 
      in&rsquo; to us, we could dae&rsquo;t quite easy. Look at the profit&rsquo; aff mulk
      itsel&rsquo;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me! hae ye come into a fortune?&rdquo; cried Jinnet eagerly. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that
      droll? I was jist sayin&rsquo; to Erchie that I, wisht somebody would leave me
      something and I would buy him a new topcoat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be a&rsquo; richt,&rdquo; said Duffy. &ldquo;If he&rsquo;ll gie me a haund wi&rsquo; this thing
      I called aboot the nicht, I&rsquo;ll stand him the finest topcoat in Gleska, if
      it costs a pound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s ca&rsquo;in on lawyers and the like o&rsquo; that ye want me to dae,&rdquo; said
      Erchie, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m nae use to ye. I&rsquo;ve a fine wye wi&rsquo; me for ministers and the
      like o&rsquo; that, that&rsquo;s no&rsquo; aye wantin&rsquo; to get the better o&rsquo; ye, but lawyers
      is different. I yince went to a lawyer that was a member in oor kirk to
      ask him if he didna think it was time for him to pay his sate-rents. He
      said he would think it ower, and a week efter that he sent me an account
      for six- and-eightpence for consultation. But I&rsquo;m prood to hear ye&rsquo;ve come
      in for something, Duffy, whether I get a topcoat or no&rsquo;. I never kent ye
      had ony rich freen&rsquo;s at a&rsquo;. Faith, ye&rsquo;re weel aff; look at me, I havena a
      rich freen&rsquo; in the warld except&mdash;except Jinnet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I never kent she was that weel aff,&rdquo; cried Mrs Duffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it her!&rdquo; said Erchie. &ldquo;She has that much money in the bank that the
      bank clerks touch their hats to her in the street if she has on her Sunday
      claes. But that wasna whit I was thinkin&rsquo; o&rsquo;; there&rsquo;s ither kinds o&rsquo; 
      riches besides the sort they keep in banks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind him, he&rsquo;s an auld fuiter,&rdquo; said Jinnet, spreading a tablecloth
      on the table and preparing for the tea. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m shair I&rsquo;m gled to hear o&rsquo; 
      your good luck. It doesna dae to build oorsel&rsquo;s up on money, for money&rsquo;s
      no everything, as the pickpocket said when he took the watch as weel; but
      we&rsquo;re a&rsquo; quite ready to thole&rsquo;t. Ye&rsquo;ll be plannin&rsquo; whit ye&rsquo;ll dae wi&rsquo;t,
      Mrs Duffy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First and foremost we&rsquo;re gaun to get rid o&rsquo; the ree, at onyrate,&rdquo; said
      Mrs Duffy emphatically. &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;re gaun to get a piano.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can ye play?&rdquo; asked Erchie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; admitted Mrs Duffy, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s nae need tae play sae lang&rsquo;s ye can
      get a vinolia to play for ye. I think we&rsquo;ll flit at the term to yin o&rsquo; yon
      hooses roond the corner, wi&rsquo; the tiled closes, and maybe keep a wee
      servant lassie. I&rsquo;m that nervous at havin&rsquo; to rise for the mulk in the
      mornin&rsquo;. No&rsquo; an awfu&rsquo; big servant wi&rsquo; keps and aiprons, ye understaund,
      but yin I could train into the thing. I&rsquo;m no&rsquo; for nane o&rsquo; your late
      dinners, I jist like to tak&rsquo; something in my hand for my supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Och ay, ye&rsquo;ll can easy get a wee no&rsquo; awfu&rsquo; strong yin frae the country,
      chape,&rdquo; said Erchie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye must tak&rsquo; care o&rsquo; yer ain health, Mrs Duffy, and if ye&rsquo;re nervous,
      risin&rsquo; in the mornin&rsquo; to tak&rsquo; in the mulk&rsquo;s no&rsquo; for ye. But my! ye&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; 
      be for speakin&rsquo; to the like o&rsquo; us when ye come into your fortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no&rsquo; exactly whit ye wad ca&rsquo; a fortune,&rdquo; Duffy explained, as they
      drew in their chairs to the table. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a heap o&rsquo; money to get a&rsquo; at
      yince withoot daein&rsquo; onything for&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will ye hae to gang into mournin&rsquo;s for the body that left it?&rdquo; Jinnet
      asked Mrs Duffy. &ldquo;I ken a puir weedow wumman that would come to the hoose
      to sew for ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re aff it a&rsquo;thegither,&rdquo; said Duffy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s naebody that left it to us&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      a medallion. Whit I wanted to ask ye, Erchie, is this&mdash;whit&rsquo;s a
      medallion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jist a kind o&rsquo; a medal,&rdquo; said Erchie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My jove!&rdquo; said Duffy, &ldquo;the wife was richt efter a&rsquo;. I thocht it was
      something for playin&rsquo; on, like a melodian. Weel, it doesna maitter, ye&rsquo;ve
      heard o&rsquo; the hidden treasure the newspapers&rsquo;s puttin&rsquo; here and there roond
      the country? I ken where yin o&rsquo; them&rsquo;s hidden. At least I ken where
      there&rsquo;s a medallion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hoo nice!&rdquo; said Jinnet. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfu&rsquo; smert o&rsquo; ye, Mr Duffy. I was just
      readin&rsquo; aboot them, and was jist hopin&rsquo; some puir body wad get them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&rsquo; that poor naither!&rdquo; said Mrs Duffy, with a little warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Na, na, I wasna sayin&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;I didna mean ony hairm,&rdquo; said poor
      Jinnet. &ldquo;Streetch yer hand, and tak&rsquo; a bit cake. That&rsquo;s a rale nice brooch
      ye hae gotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Erchie looked at Duffy dubiously. For a moment he feared the coalman might
      be trying on some elaborate new kind of joke, but the complacency of his
      face put it out of the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then my advice to you, Duffy, if ye ken where the medallion is,&rdquo; said
      Erchie, &ldquo;is to gang and howk it up at yince, or somebody&rsquo;ll be there afore
      ye. I warrant it&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; get time to tak&rsquo; root if it&rsquo;s within a penny ride
      on the Gleska skoosh cars. There&rsquo;s thoosands o&rsquo; people oot wi&rsquo; lanterns at
      this very meenute scrapin&rsquo; dirt in the hunt for that medallion. Hoo do ye
      ken whaur it is if ye havena seen it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s there richt enough,&rdquo; said Mrs Duffy; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s in the paper, and we&rsquo;re
      gaun to gie up the ree; my mind&rsquo;s made up on that. I hope ye&rsquo;ll come and
      see us sometime in our new hoose&mdash;house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It says in the paper,&rdquo; said Duffy, &ldquo;that the medallion&rsquo;s up a street that
      has a public-hoose at each end o&rsquo;t, and a wee pawn in the middle, roond
      the corner o&rsquo; anither street, where ye can see twa laundries at yince, and
      a sign ower yin o&rsquo; them that puts ye in mind o&rsquo; the battle o&rsquo; Waterloo,
      then in a parteecular place twenty yairds to the richt o&rsquo; a pend-close wi&rsquo; 
      a barrow in&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Erchie laughed. &ldquo;Wi&rsquo; a barrow in&rsquo;t?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;They micht as weel hae said
      wi&rsquo; a polisman in&rsquo;t; barrows is like bobbies&mdash;if ye think ye&rsquo;ll get
      them where ye want them ye&rsquo;re up a close yersel&rsquo;. And whit&rsquo;s the
      parteecular place, Duffy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Duffy leaned forward and whispered mysteriously, &ldquo;My coal-ree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we&rsquo;re gaun to gie&rsquo;t up,&rdquo; explained his wife. &ldquo;Oh, ay, we&rsquo;re gaun to
      give the ree up. Ye hae no idea whaur&mdash;where&mdash;I could get a
      smert wee lassie that would not eat awfu&rsquo; much, Mrs MacPherson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I measured it a&rsquo; aff,&rdquo; Duffy went on. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s oor street richt enough; the
      pubs is there&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;-I could bate ye they are,&rdquo; said Erchie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they werena there it wad be a miracle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;-and the laundries is there. &lsquo;Colin Campbell&rsquo; over yin o&rsquo; 
      them, him that bate Bonypart, ye ken, and twenty yairds frae the
      pend-close is richt under twenty ton o&rsquo; coal I put in last week. It&rsquo;s no&rsquo; 
      M&rsquo;Callum&rsquo;s wid-yaird; it&rsquo;s my ree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My papa was the sole proprietor of a large wid-yaird,&rdquo; irrelevantly
      remarked Mrs Duffy; who was getting more and more Englified as the details
      of the prospective fortune came put.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was he, indeed,&rdquo; said Jinnet. &ldquo;That was nice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Noo, whit I wanted you to dae for me,&rdquo; Duffy went on, &ldquo;was to come awa&rsquo; 
      doon wi&rsquo; me the nicht and gie&rsquo;s a hand to shift thae coals. I daurna ask
      ony o&rsquo; my men to come, for they wad claim halfers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Erchie toyed with a teaspoon and looked at the coalman, half in pity, half
      with amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man, ye&rsquo;re a rale divert,&rdquo; said he at last. &ldquo;Do ye think the newspapers
      would be at the bother o&rsquo; puttin&rsquo; their medallion under twenty ton o&rsquo; coal
      in your coal-ree, or ony body else&rsquo;s? Na, na, they can mak&rsquo; their money
      easier nor that. If ye tak&rsquo;, my advice, ye&rsquo;ll put a penny on the bag o&rsquo; 
      coal and gie short wecht, and ye&rsquo;ll mak&rsquo; your fortune far shairer than
      lookin&rsquo; under&rsquo;t for medallions.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then ye&rsquo;re no&rsquo; game to gie&rsquo;s a hand?&rdquo; said Duffy, starting another
      cookie. &ldquo;See&rsquo;s the sugar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not me!&rdquo; said Erchie promptly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a flet fit and a warm hert, but I&rsquo;m
      no&rsquo; a&rsquo;thegither a born idiot to howk coal for medallions that&rsquo;s no&rsquo; 
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next day Duffy came up with two bags of coals which Jinnet had ordered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did ye find the medallion?&rdquo; she asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didna need to look for&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I heard efter I left here last
      nicht that a man found it in a back-coort in the Garscube Road. Them sort
      of dydoes should be put doon by the polis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, whit a peety!&rdquo; said Jinnet. &ldquo;And hoo&rsquo;s the mistress the day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; said Duffy. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s ca&rsquo;in&rsquo; me Jimmy again; it was naething
      but Mr Duffy wi&rsquo; her as lang&rsquo;s she thocht we were to get rid o&rsquo; the ree.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XXIV THE VALENTEEN
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>n the night of the
      last Trades House dinner I walked home with Erchie when his work was done.
      It was the 13th of February. There are little oil-and-colour shops in New
      City Road, where at that season the windows become literary and artistic,
      and display mock valentines. One of these windows caught my old friend&rsquo;s
      eye, and he stopped to look in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;time flies! It was only yesterday we had the last o&rsquo; oor
      Ne&rsquo;erday currant-bun, and here&rsquo;s the valenteens! That minds me I maun buy&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
       He stopped and looked at me, a little embarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could only look inquiry back at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll think I&rsquo;m droll,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but it just cam&rsquo; in my heid to buy a
      valenteen. To-morrow&rsquo;s Jinnet&rsquo;s birthday, and it wad be a rale divert to
      send her ladyship yin and tak&rsquo; a kind o; rise oot o&rsquo; her. Come and gie&rsquo;s a
      hand to pick a nice yin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I went into the oil-and-colour shop, but, alas! for the ancient lover, he
      found there that the day of sentiment was done so far as the 14th of
      February was concerned. .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hae ye ony nice valenteens?&rdquo; he asked a boy behind the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is&rsquo;t a comic ye mean?&rdquo; asked the boy, apparently not much amazed at so
      strange an application from an elderly gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A comic!&rdquo; said my friend in disdain. &ldquo;Dae I look like the kind o&rsquo; chap
      that sends mock valenteens? If ye gie me ony o&rsquo; your chat I&rsquo;ll tell yer
      mither, ye wee&mdash;ye wee rascal! Ye&rsquo;ll be asking me next if I want a
      mooth harmonium. Dae ye think I&rsquo;m angry wi&rsquo; the cook in some hoose roond
      in-the terraces because she&rsquo;s-chief wi&rsquo; the letter-carrier? I&rsquo;ll comic
      ye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weel, it&rsquo;s only comics we hae,&rdquo; said the youthful shopkeeper; &ldquo;the only
      ither kind we hae&rsquo;s Christmas cairds, and I think we&rsquo;re oot o&rsquo; them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was a business-like boy,&mdash;he flung a pile of the mock valentines
      on the counter before us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Erchie turned them over with contemptuous fingers. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a gey droll age
      we live in,&rdquo; said he to me. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re far ower funny, though ye wadna think
      it to see us. I have a great respect for valenteens, for if it wasna for a
      valenteen there maybe wadna hae been ony Jinnet&mdash;at least in my
      hoose. I wad gie a shillin&rsquo; for a rale auld-fashioned valenteen that gaed
      oot and in like a concertina, wi&rsquo; lace roond aboot it, and a smell o&rsquo; 
      scent aff it, and twa silver herts on&rsquo;t skewered through the middle the
      same as it was for brandering. Ye havena seen mony o&rsquo; that kind, laddie?
      Na, I daursay no&rsquo;; they were oot afore your time, though I thocht ye micht
      hae some in the back-shop. They were the go when we werena nearly sae
      smert as we are nooadays. I&rsquo;m gled I havena to start the coortin&rsquo; again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He came on one of the garish sheets that was less vulgar than the others,
      with the picture of a young lady under an umbrella, and a verse of not
      unkindly doggerel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll hae to dae,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;although it&rsquo;s onything but fancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; said I dubiously, &ldquo;that Mrs Mac-Pherson will appreciate it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s the very yin that will,&rdquo; he assured me as he put it in his pocket.
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s like mysel&rsquo;; she canna play the piano, but she has better gifts,&mdash;she
      has the fear o&rsquo; God and a sense o&rsquo; humour. You come up the morn&rsquo;s nicht at
      eight, afore the post comes, and ye&rsquo;ll see the ploy when she gets her
      valenteen. I&rsquo;ll be slippin&rsquo; oot and postin&rsquo;t in the forenoon. Though a
      young lassie canna get her valenteens ower early in the mornin&rsquo;, a
      mairried wife&rsquo;s&rsquo;ll dae very weel efter her wark&rsquo;s done for the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s yersel&rsquo;?&rdquo; said Mrs MacPherson when I went to her door. &ldquo;Come awa&rsquo; 
      in. I kent there was a stranger comin&rsquo;,&mdash;though indeed I wadna be
      ca&rsquo;in&rsquo; you a stranger,&mdash;for there was a stranger on the ribs o&rsquo; the
      grate this mornin&rsquo;, and a knife fell aff the table when we were at oor
      tea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, and hoo knocked it aff deeliberate?&rdquo; interposed her husband, rising
      to welcome me. &ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s the sly yin. She&rsquo;s that fond to see folk come
      aboot the hoose she whiles knocks a knife aff the table to see if it&rsquo;ll
      bring them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Erchie MacPherson!&rdquo; cried his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no blamin&rsquo; ye,&rdquo; he went on; &ldquo;I ken I&rsquo;m gey dreich company for
      onybody. I havena a heid for mindin&rsquo; ony scandal aboot the folk we ken,
      and I canna understaund politics noo that Gledstone&rsquo;s no&rsquo; to the fore, and
      I danna sing, or play a tune on ony thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to him!&rdquo; cried Jinnet. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he the awfu&rsquo; man? Did ye ever hear
      the like o&rsquo; him for nonsense?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The kettle was on the fire: I knew from experience that it had been put
      there when my knock came to the door, for so the good lady&rsquo;s hospitality
      always manifested itself, so that her kettle was off and on the fire a
      score of times a-day, ready to be brought to the boil if it was a visitor
      who knocked, and not a beggar or a pedlar of pipeclay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tak&rsquo; a watter biscuit,&rdquo; Jinnet pressed me as we sat at the table;
      &ldquo;they&rsquo;re awfu&rsquo; nice wi&rsquo; saut butter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hae ye nae syrup to put on them?&rdquo; asked her husband with a sly glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nane o&rsquo; yer nonsense,&rdquo; she exclaimed, and attempted a diversion in the
      conversation, but Erchie plainly had a joke to retail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell ye a bawr aboot watter biscuits and syrup,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;When I
      was coortin&rsquo; my first lass I wasna mair nor nineteen years o&rsquo; age, and
      jist a thin peely-wally callant, mair like playin&rsquo; moshy at the bools than
      rinnin&rsquo; efter lassies. The lassie&rsquo;s faither and mither jist made fun o&rsquo; 
      us, and when I wad be gaun up to her hoose, lettin&rsquo; on it was her brither
      I wanted to see, they used to affront me afore their dochter wi&rsquo; speakin&rsquo; 
      aboot the Sunday-School and the Band o&rsquo; Hope I belanged to (because the
      lassie belanged to them tae), and askin&rsquo; me if I was fond o&rsquo; sugar to my
      parridge, and when I was thinkin&rsquo; o&rsquo; startin&rsquo; the shavin&rsquo;. I didna like
      it, but I jist had to put up wi&rsquo;t. But the worst blow ever I got frae them
      was yince when I gaed up wi&rsquo; a new pair o&rsquo; lavender breeks, and the
      lassie&rsquo;s mither, for the fun o&rsquo; the thing, asked me if I wad hae a piece
      and jeely. I tellt her I wasna heedin&rsquo;, that I was jist efter haein&rsquo; my
      tea; but she went and spread syrup on a watter biscuit and handed it to me
      the same as if I was a wee lauddie wi&rsquo; a grauvit on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jinnet laughed softly at the picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, ye may lauch,&rdquo; said her husband. &ldquo;There was nae lauchin&rsquo; in my heid,
      I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; ye. For there was the syrup comin&rsquo; dreepin&rsquo; through the holes
      in the watter biscuit, so that I had to haud the biscuit up every noo and
      then and lick in below&rsquo;t so as to keep the syrup frae gaun on my braw
      lavender breeks. A bonny object for a lass to look at, and it was jist to
      mak&rsquo; me look reediculous her mither did it. She thocht I was faur ower
      young to be comin&rsquo; efter her dochter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So ye were,&rdquo; said Jinnet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m shair ye hadna muckle sense at the time,
      or it wadna be yon yin ye went coortin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe no&rsquo;; but I never rued it,&rdquo; said Erchie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was as glaikit as yersel&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Jinnet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was the cleverest, lass in the place,&rdquo; protested Erchie. &ldquo;My! the
      things she could sew, and crochet, and mak&rsquo; doon, and bake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her sister Phemie was faur cleverer than she was,&rdquo; said Jinnet. &ldquo;She
      couldna haud a candle to her sister Phemie in tambourin&rsquo; or in
      ginger-breid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And dancin&rsquo;! She could dance on a cobweb and no&rsquo; put a toe through&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll need a line wi&rsquo; that yin, Erchie,&rdquo; said his wife, who did not seem
      remarkably jealous of this first love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye should hear her singin&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wad hae been far better mendin&rsquo; her wee brither&rsquo;s stockin&rsquo;s, and no&rsquo; 
      leavin&rsquo; her mither to dae&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Jinnet. &ldquo;She was a gey licht-heided
      yin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Erchie seemed merciless in his reminiscence,&mdash;I really felt sorry for
      his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye may say whit ye like to run her doon, but ye canna deny her looks.&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her looks dinna concern me,&rdquo; said Jinnet abruptly. &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re jist an auld
      haver; think shame o&rsquo; yersel&rsquo;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye ken ye canna deny&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;It was alooed all over the place
      she was the belle. I wasna the only yin that was efter her wi&rsquo; my lavender
      breeks. She kept the Band o&rsquo; Hope for nearly twa years frae burstin&rsquo; up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; listen to anither word,&rdquo; protested Jinnet, now in obvious
      vexation; and mercifully there came a rapping at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      She returned to the kitchen with an envelope and a little parcel. Erchie
      winked at me, hugging to himself a great delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder wha in the world can be writin&rsquo; to me,&rdquo; said she, looking at the
      addresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll likely be an accoont for di&rsquo;mond tararas or dressmaking,&rdquo; said
      Erchie. &ldquo;Oh you weemen! Ye&rsquo;re a perfect ruination. But if I was you I wad
      open them and see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She opened the envelope first. It was Erchie&rsquo;s valentine, and she knew it,
      for when she read the verse she shook her head at him laughingly, and a
      little ashamed. &ldquo;When will ye be wise?&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she opened the little parcel: it contained a trivial birthday gift
      from an anonymous friend in whose confidence only I, of all the three in
      the room, happened to be. Vainly they speculated about his identity
      without suspecting me; but I noticed that it was on her valentine Jinnet
      set most value. She held it long in her hand, thinking, and was about to
      put it into a chest of drawers without letting me see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye needna be hidin&rsquo; it,&rdquo; said her husband then. &ldquo;He saw it already.
      Faith! he helped me to pick it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fair affronted,&rdquo; she exclaimed, reddening at this exposure. &ldquo;You and
      your valenteens!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s naething wrang wi&rsquo; valenteens,&rdquo; said her husband. &ldquo;If it wasna
      for a valenteen I wad never hae got ye. I could never say to your face but
      that I liked ye; but the valenteen had a word that&rsquo;s far mair brazen than
      &lsquo;like,&rsquo; ye mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Erchie!&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;you must have been blate in these days. The word
      was&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put up his hand in alarm and stopped me. &ldquo;Wheesht!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
      word that need never be mentioned here where we&rsquo;re a&rsquo; three Scotch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what came over the first lass, Erchie?&rdquo; I asked, determined to have
      the end of that romance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked across at his wife and smiled. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s there hersel&rsquo;,&rdquo; said he,
      &ldquo;and ye better ask her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Jinnet?&rdquo; I cried, amazed at my own obtuseness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jinnet of course,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Wha else wad it be if it wasna Jinnet? She&rsquo;s
      the Rale Oreeginal.&rdquo;
     </p>

      XXV AMONG THE PICTURES
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>haur are ye gaun
      the day?&rdquo; said Erchie to Duffy on Saturday afternoon when he came on the
      worthy coalman standing at his own close-mouth, looking up and down the
      street with the hesitation of a man who deliberates how he is to make the
      most of his Saturday half-holiday.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was jist switherin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Duffy. &ldquo;Since I got mairried and stopped
      gaun to the Mull o&rsquo; Kintyre Vaults, there&rsquo;s no&rsquo; much choice for a chap. I
      micht as weel be leevin&rsquo; in the country for a&rsquo; the life I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man, aye!&rdquo; said Erchie, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the warst o&rsquo; Gleska; there&rsquo;s nae life
      in&rsquo;t&mdash;naethin&rsquo; daein&rsquo;. Ye should try yer hand at takin&rsquo; oot the wife
      for a walk, jist for the novelty o&rsquo; the thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Catch me!&rdquo; said Duffy. &ldquo;She wad see ower mony things in the shop windows
      she was needin&rsquo;. I was jist wonderin&rsquo; whether I wad buy a &lsquo;Weekly Mail&rsquo; or
      gang to the fitba&rsquo; match at Parkheid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Erchie looked pityingly at him. &ldquo;A fitba&rsquo; match!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Whit&rsquo;s the use
      o&rsquo; gaun to a fitba&rsquo; match when ye can see a&rsquo; aboot it in the late
      edeetion? Forbye, a fitba&rsquo; match doesna improve the mind; it&rsquo;s only sport.
      I&rsquo;ll tell ye whit I&rsquo;ll dae wi&rsquo; ye if ye&rsquo;re game. I&rsquo;ll tak&rsquo; ye to the Art
      Institute; the minister gied me twa tickets. Awa&rsquo; and put on your collar
      and I&rsquo;ll wait here on ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do ye need a collar for the gallery?&rdquo; asked Duffy, who thought the Art
      Institute was a music-hall. On this point Erchie set him right, and ten
      minutes later, with a collar whose rough edges rasped his neck and made
      him unhappy, he was on his way to Sauchiehall Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      The band was playing a waltz tune as they entered the Institute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind, I&rsquo;m no&rsquo; on for ony dancin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Duffy explained. &ldquo;I canna be bothered
      dancin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s naebody gaun to ask ye to dance,&rdquo; said Erchie. &ldquo;Do you think
      there couldna be a baun&rsquo; playin&rsquo; withoot dancin&rsquo;? It&rsquo;s jist here to cod a
      lot o&rsquo; folk into the notion that they can be cheery enough in a place o&rsquo; 
      the kind in spite o&rsquo; the pictures. And ye can get aifternoon tea here,
      too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could be daein&rsquo; wi&rsquo; a gless o&rsquo; beer,&rdquo; said Duffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. They&rsquo;re no&rsquo; that length yet,&rdquo; Erchie explained. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only the
      tea. The mair determined lovers o&rsquo; the Fine Arts can dae the hale show in
      an aifternoon noo wi&rsquo; the help o&rsquo; a cup o&rsquo; tea, so that they needna come
      back again. It&rsquo;s a great savin&rsquo;. They used to hae to gang hame for their
      tea afore, and whiles they never got back. The Institute wasna popular in
      thae days; it was that quate and secluded that if a chap had done onything
      wrang and the detectives were efter him he took a season ticket, and spent
      a&rsquo; his days here. Noo, ye can see for yersel&rsquo; the place is gaun like an
      inn. That&rsquo;s the effect o&rsquo; the baun&rsquo; and the aifternoon tea. If they added
      a baby incubator to the attractions the same&rsquo;s they hae in the East-End
      Exhibeetion, they would need the Fire Brigade wi&rsquo; a hose to keep the
      croods oot. Ye hae nae idea o&rsquo; the fascination Art has for the people o&rsquo; 
      Gleska if they&rsquo;re no&rsquo; driven to&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My jove!&rdquo; exclaimed Duffy, at the sight of the first gallery. &ldquo;Whit a lot
      o&rsquo; pictures! There&rsquo;ll be a pile o&rsquo; money in a place o&rsquo; this kind. Hiv they
      no water-shoot, or a shootin&rsquo; jungle, or onything lively like that?&rdquo;

      &ldquo;Man, ye&rsquo;re awfu&rsquo; common, whiles, Duffy,&rdquo; said Erchie. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fear&rsquo;t I
      wasted my ticket on ye. This is no&rsquo; an ordinary show for haein&rsquo; fun at;
      it&rsquo;s for enlargin&rsquo; the mind, openin&rsquo; the e&rsquo;en to the beauties o&rsquo; nature,
      and sellin&rsquo; pictures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they a&rsquo; for sale?&rdquo; asked Duffy, looking with great intentness at a
      foggy impression by Sidaner, the French artist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&rsquo; the hale o&rsquo; them; there&rsquo;s some on lend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could hae lent them a topper,&rdquo; said Duffy,&mdash;&ldquo;faur aheid o&rsquo; 
      onything here. It&rsquo;s a drawin&rsquo; o&rsquo; a horse I yince had in my first lorry; it
      was pented for me by a penter that lodged above us, and had a great name
      for signboards. It cost me nearly a pound wan wye or anither, though I
      provided the pent mysel&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, Art&rsquo;s a costly thing,&rdquo; said Erchie. &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll seldom get a good picture
      under a pound. It&rsquo;s no&rsquo; athegither the pent, it&rsquo;s the layin&rsquo; o&rsquo;t on by
      hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This yin&rsquo;s done by hand onywye,&rdquo; said Duffy, pointing to the foggy
      impression by Sidaner. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfu&rsquo; like as if somebody had done it
      themsel&rsquo;s in their spare time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You and me&rsquo;s no&rsquo; judges o&rsquo; that sort o&rsquo; thing,&rdquo; said Erchie. &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s
      no&rsquo; near so bad as it looks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye see,&rdquo; Erchie went on, &ldquo;Art pentin&rsquo;s a tred by itsel&rsquo;. There used to be
      hardly ony picture-penters in Gleska; it was a&rsquo; shipbuildin&rsquo; and
      calanderin&rsquo;, whitever that is, and chemical works that needed big lums.
      When a Gleska man did a guid stroke o&rsquo; business on the Stock Exchange, or
      had money left him in thae days, and his wife wanted a present, he had his
      photy-graph ta&rsquo;en big size, ile-coloured by hand. It was gey like him, the
      photygraph, and so everybody kent it wasna the rale Art. Folk got rich
      that quick in Gleska, and had sae much money to spend, that the
      photygraphers couldna keep up wi&rsquo; the&rsquo;demand, and then the hand-pentin&rsquo; 
      chaps began to open works in different pairts o&rsquo; the city. Ye&rsquo;ll hardly
      gang into a hoose noo whaur ye&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; see the guidman&rsquo;s picture in ile,
      and it micht be bilin&rsquo; ile sometimes, judgin&rsquo; from the agony in his face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My jove!&rdquo; said Duffy, &ldquo;is it sore to get done that wye?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sore!&rdquo; replied Erchie; &ldquo;no, nor sore. At least, no&rsquo; that awfu&rsquo; sore. They
      wadna need to dae&rsquo;t unless they liked. When maistly a&rsquo; the weel-aff Gleska
      folk had got their photygraphs done and then de&rsquo;ed, the penters had to
      start the landscape brench o&rsquo; the business. Them&rsquo;s landscapes a&rsquo; roon&rsquo; 
      aboot&rdquo;&mdash;and Erchie gave his arm a comprehensive sweep to suggest all
      the walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They must be pretty smert chaps that does them,&rdquo; said Duffy. &ldquo;I wish I
      had gone in for the pentin&rsquo; mysel&rsquo;; it&rsquo;s cleaner nor the coals. Dae ye hae
      to serve your time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nor time; ye can see for yersel&rsquo; that it&rsquo;s jist a kind o&rsquo; knack like
      poetry&mdash;or waitin&rsquo;. And the plant doesna cost much; a&rsquo; ye need to
      start wi&rsquo;s paper, brushes, pent, and a saft hat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A saft hat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay; a saft hat&rsquo;s the sure sign o&rsquo; an artist. I ken hunners o&rsquo; them;
      Gleska&rsquo;s fair hotchin&rsquo; wi&rsquo; artists. If the Cairters&rsquo; Trip wasna abolished,
      ye wad see the artists&rsquo; tred union walkin&rsquo; oot wi&rsquo; the rest o&rsquo; them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two friends went conscientiously round the rooms, Erchie expounding on
      the dimensions, frames, and literary merits of the pictures, Duffy a
      patient, humble student, sometime&rsquo;s bewildered at the less obvious
      transcripts of nature and life pointed out to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there much mair o&rsquo; this to see?&rdquo; he asked at last, after having gone
      through the fourth gallery. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gettin&rsquo; dizzy. Could we no&rsquo; hae something
      at the tea bar if we gied them a tip? They micht send oot for&rsquo;t. Or we
      micht get a pass-oot check.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mair to see!&rdquo; exclaimed Erchie. &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re awfu&rsquo; easy made dizzy! The like o&rsquo; 
      you wad faur raither be oot skreichin&rsquo; yer heid aff at the fitba&rsquo; match at
      Parkheid, instead o&rsquo; improvin&rsquo; the mind here. Ye canna get onything at the
      tea place but jist tea, I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; ye, and there&rsquo;s nae pass-oot checks.
      They ken better nor to gie ye pass-oot checks; haulf o&rsquo; your kind wad
      never come back again if yince ye escaped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My jove!&rdquo; said Duffy, suddenly, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a corker!&rdquo; and he indicated a
      rather peculiar drawing with a lady artist&rsquo;s name attached to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Erchie himself was staggered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ca&rsquo;d &lsquo;The Sleeper&rsquo; in the catalogue,&rdquo;
       said he. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wumman, and her dozin&rsquo;. The leddy that pented it wasna
      ower lavish wi&rsquo; her pent. That&rsquo;s whit they ca&rsquo; New Art, Duffy; it jist
      shows ye whit weemen can dae if ye let them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And dae ye tell me there&rsquo;s weemen penters!&rdquo; asked Duffy in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course there&rsquo;s weemen penters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And hoo dae they get up and doon lethers?&rdquo; asked Duffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; ye Art pentin&rsquo;s a brench by itsel&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Erchie. &ldquo;The lady
      Art penters divna pent windows and rhones and hooses; they bash brass, and
      hack wud, and draw pictures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And can they mak&rsquo; a livin&rsquo; at that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whiles. And whiles their paw helps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My jove!&rdquo; said Duffy, bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll gang on to the next room noo,&rdquo; said Erchie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wad raither come back some ither day,&rdquo; said Duffy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m enjoyin&rsquo; this
      fine, but I promised the wife I wad be hame early for my tea.&rdquo; And
      together they hastily made an exit into Sauchie-hall Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder wha won the semi-final at Parkheid,&rdquo; said Duffy. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll awa&rsquo; 
      doon the toon and see; whit&rsquo;s the use o&rsquo; hurryin&rsquo; hame?&rdquo;

      XXVI THE PROBATIONARY GHOST
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>ne day I observed
      Erchie going off the pavement rather than walk under a ladder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are you superstitious too?&rdquo; I asked him, surprised at this
      unsuspected trait in a character so generally sensible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care whither ye ca&rsquo;t supresteetion or no,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;but
      walkin&rsquo; under lethers is a gey chancy thing; and there&rsquo;s mony a chancy
      thing, and I&rsquo;m neither that young nor that weel aff that I can afford to
      be takin&rsquo; ony risks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to learn that you believed in
      ghosts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I no&rsquo;?&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;And guid reason for&rsquo;t! Did I no&rsquo; yince see yin?
      It was the time I had the rheumatic fever, when we were stayin&rsquo; in
      Garnethill. I was jist gettin&rsquo; better, and sittin&rsquo; up a wee while in the
      evenin&rsquo; to air the bed, and Jinnet was oot for a message. The nicht was
      wild and wet, and the win&rsquo; was daudin&rsquo; awa&rsquo; at the window like onything,
      and I was feelin&rsquo; gey eerie, and wearyin&rsquo; for the wife to come back. I was
      listenin&rsquo; for her fit on the stair, when the ootside door opens, and in a
      second there was a chap at the kitchen door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Come in if your feet&rsquo;s clean,&rsquo; says I, pretty snappy. &lsquo;Seein&rsquo; ye&rsquo;ve made
      sae free wi&rsquo; the ae door ye needna mak&rsquo; ony ceremony wi&rsquo; this ane.&rsquo; I
      heard the hinges screechin&rsquo;, but naebody cam&rsquo; in, and I looks roon&rsquo; frae
      where I was sittin&rsquo; wi&rsquo; a blanket roond me at the fire, and there was the
      ghost keekin&rsquo; in. He was a wee nyaf o&rsquo; a thing, wi&rsquo; a Paisley whisker, a
      face no bigger than a Geneva watch, a nickerbocker suit on, Rab Roy tartan
      tops to his gowfin&rsquo; stockings, and pot-bellied to the bargain. I kent fine
      he was a ghost at the first gae-aff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s you,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;Come in and gies yer crack till Jinnet comes. Losh,
      it&rsquo;s no&rsquo; a nicht for stravaigin&rsquo;.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He cam&rsquo; glidin&rsquo; in withoot makin&rsquo; ony soond at a&rsquo;, and sat doon on a
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ye&rsquo;re no&rsquo; feared,&rsquo; says he, tryin&rsquo; to gnash his teeth, and makin&rsquo; a puir
      job o&rsquo;t, for they were maistly artifeecial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Feared?&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;No&rsquo; me! I never did onybody ony hairm that wad mak&rsquo; it
      worth ony ghost&rsquo;s while to meddle wi&rsquo; me. A flet fit but a warm hert.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll see aboot that,&rsquo; says he, as cocky as onything. &lsquo;I had a fine job
      findin&rsquo; oot where ye were. Fancy me gaun awa&rsquo; doon to Millport on a nicht
      like this to haunt ye, and findin&rsquo; that ye had flitted up here last term.&rsquo; 
      And he begood to gnash his teeth again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Millport!&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;Man! I was never near the place, and I&rsquo;ve lived in
      this hoose for seventeen year, and brocht up a faimily in&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never seen a ghost mair vexed than he was when I tellt him that. His
      jaw fell; he was nearly greetin&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Whit&rsquo;s yer name?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Erchie MacPherson, and I&rsquo;m no&rsquo; ashamed o&rsquo;t. Its no&rsquo; in ony grocers&rsquo; nor
      tylers&rsquo; books that I ken o&rsquo;, and if I ever murdered ony weans or onything
      o&rsquo; that sort, it must hae been when I was sleepin&rsquo;. I doot, my man, ye&rsquo;re
      up the wrang close.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ghost begood to swear. Oh my! such swearin&rsquo;. I never listened to the
      bate o&rsquo;t. There was fancy words in&rsquo;t I never heard in a&rsquo; my life, and I&rsquo;ve
      kent a wheen o&rsquo; cairters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s jist like them,&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;They tellt me Millport; and efter I
      couldna find the man I was wantin&rsquo; at Millport, I was tellt it was here,
      No. 16 Buccleuch Street. Fancy me bungin&rsquo; awa&rsquo; through the air on a nicht
      like this! My nicker-bockers is fair stickin&rsquo; to my knees wi&rsquo; wet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Peter,&rsquo; says I (of course I didna ken his richt name, but I thocht I wad
      be nice wi&rsquo; the chap see-in&rsquo; he had made such a mistake), &lsquo;Peter,&rsquo; said I,
      &lsquo;ye&rsquo;re needin&rsquo; yer specs on. This is no&rsquo; No. 16, it&rsquo;s number 18, and I
      think the man ye maun be lookin&rsquo; for is Jeckson, that canvasses for the
      sewin&rsquo;-machines. He came here last term frae aboot Millport. If he&rsquo;s done
      ony hairm to ony-body in his past life&mdash;murdered a wife, and buried
      her under the hearth-stane or ony daft-like thing o&rsquo; that sort,&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      no&rsquo; wantin&rsquo; to hear onything aboot it, for he&rsquo;s a guid enough neebour, has
      twa bonny wee weans, comes hame regular to his tea, and gangs to the kirk
      wi&rsquo; his wife. He&rsquo;s been teetotal ever since he came here. Gie the chap a
      chance!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Jeckson!&rsquo; said the ghost, and whips oot a wee book. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the very
      man!&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;Man! is&rsquo;t no&rsquo; aggravatin&rsquo;? Here&rsquo;s me skooshin&rsquo; up and doon
      the coast wi&rsquo; my thin flannels on lookin&rsquo; for him, and him toastin&rsquo; his
      taes at a fire in Buccleuch Street! Jist you wait. It shows ye the wye the
      books in oor place is kept. If the office was richt up-to-date, Jeckson
      wadna be flitted ten meenutes when his new address wad be marked doon. No
      wonder the Americans is batin&rsquo; us! Weel, it&rsquo;s no&rsquo; my faut if I&rsquo;m up the
      wrang close, and I&rsquo;m no&rsquo; gaun to start the job the nicht. I&rsquo;m far ower
      cauld.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was an empty gless and a teaspoon on the dresser, for Jinnet had
      been giein&rsquo; me a drap toddy afore she gaed oot. The ghost &lsquo;sat doon on a
      chair and looked at the gless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Could ye save a life?&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Whit wad be the use o&rsquo; giein&rsquo; it to you, Peter?&rsquo; I asked him; &lsquo;ye havena
      ony inside, seein&rsquo; ye&rsquo;re a ghost.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I no&rsquo;?&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;Jist try me.&rsquo; So I pointed to the press, and he
      took oot the decanter as smert&rsquo;s ye like and helped himsel&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He turned oot a rale nice chap in spite o&rsquo; his tred, and he gave me a&rsquo; 
      the oots and ins o&rsquo;t. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve nae luck&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s my first job at the
      hauntin&rsquo;, and I&rsquo;ve made a kind o&rsquo; botch o&rsquo;t, though it&rsquo;s no&rsquo; my faut. I&rsquo;m
      a probationer; jist on my trial, like yin o&rsquo; thae U.F. ministers. Maybe ye
      think it&rsquo;s easy gettin&rsquo; a haunter&rsquo;s job; but I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; ye it&rsquo;s no&rsquo; that
      easy, and when ye get it, it&rsquo;s wark that tak&rsquo;s it oot o&rsquo; ye. There&rsquo;s mair
      gangs in for the job there than for the Ceevil Service here, and the jobs
      go to compeetition. &ldquo;Ye hae&rsquo; to pass an examination, and ye hae nae chance
      o&rsquo; gettin&rsquo; yin if ye divna mak? mair nor ninety per cent o&rsquo; points. Mind
      ye, there&rsquo;s mair than jist plain ghost-wark! It used to be, in the auld
      days, that a haunter wad be sent to dae onything,&mdash;to rattle chains,
      or gie ye the clammy hand, or be a blood-curdler.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nooadays there&rsquo;s half a dizzen different kinds o&rsquo; haunters. I&rsquo;m a
      blood-curdler mysel&rsquo;,&rsquo; and he gied a skreich that nearly broke a&rsquo; the delf
      on the dresser.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nane o&rsquo; that!&rsquo; says I, no&rsquo; very weel pleased. &lsquo;Ye&rsquo;ll hae the neebours
      doon on us. Forbye, there&rsquo;s naething patent aboot that sort o&rsquo; skreich.
      Duffy the coalman could dae better himsel&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s no&rsquo; the wye a dacent
      ghost should cairry on in ony hoose whaur he&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; a dram.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Excuse me,&rsquo; he says; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s the dram that&rsquo;s ta&rsquo;en my heid. Ye see, I&rsquo;m
      no&rsquo; used to&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s mony a day since I had yin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Are they that strict yonder?&rsquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Strict&rsquo;s no&rsquo; the word for&rsquo;t! If a blood-curdler on probation was kent to
      gang to his work wi&rsquo; the smell o&rsquo; drink aff him, he wad lose his job:&rsquo; and
      he helped himsel&rsquo; to anither dram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Weel, ye&rsquo;re no&rsquo; blate ony wye,&rsquo; says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Blate! Catch me,&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;I wadna need to be blate at this tred, I&rsquo;m
      tellin&rsquo; ye. Jist you think o&rsquo; the kind o&rsquo; customers we hae to dale wi&rsquo;!
      They wad sooner see a tax-collector comin&rsquo; into their hooses than yin o&rsquo; 
      us chaps. There&rsquo;s some hooses ye hae to gang to work in where it&rsquo;s easy. I
      ken a ghost that&rsquo;s been fifteen years on the same job, and gettin&rsquo; fat
      on&rsquo;t. He has the name o&rsquo; bein&rsquo; the best white-sheet ghost in the
      Depairt-men&rsquo;, and he&rsquo;s stationed in an auld castle up aboot the Hielan&rsquo;s,
      a job he got because he had the Gaelic. He made it sae hot for the folk,
      walkin&rsquo; aboot their bedrooms at a&rsquo; &lsquo;oors o&rsquo; the nicht, that naebody&rsquo;ll
      stay in the place but himsel&rsquo; and an auld deaf and dumb housekeeper.
      There&rsquo;s naething for him to dae, so he can lie in his bed a&rsquo; nicht and no&rsquo; 
      bother himsel&rsquo; aboot onything. It&rsquo;s a very different thing wi&rsquo; anither
      chap I ken&mdash;a chain-clanker in England. He has to drag ten yairds o&rsquo; 
      heavy chain up and doon stairs every nicht; and it&rsquo;s no easy job, I&rsquo;m
      tellin&rsquo; ye, wi&rsquo; the folk the hoose belang to pappin&rsquo; things and shootin&rsquo; 
      at whaur they think the soond comes frae. Oh ay! there&rsquo;s a great run on
      the best jobs. My ain ambeetion is to be in the clammy-hand brench o&rsquo; the
      business in some quate wee place at the coast. I hae my eye on a likely
      thing at Rothesay. Of course the clammy hand&rsquo;s no&rsquo; a very nice occupation
      for the winter, but this is a hoose that&rsquo;s shut up in the winter, and I
      wad only hae to work it in the fine summer nichts.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Hoo dae ye dae the clammy hand, Peter?&rsquo; I asked him, and he jist winked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;If I was tellin&rsquo; ye that,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;ye wad be as wise as mysel&rsquo;. Never
      you mind, MacPherson; ask me nae questions and I&rsquo;ll tell ye nae lees.
      Weel, as I was sayin&rsquo;, I aye had a notion o&rsquo; a quate job at the coast. I
      couldna stand Gleska; there&rsquo;s, such a rush aboot it, and sae mony stairs
      to sclim, and pianos aye playin&rsquo; next door. And the accent&rsquo;s awfu&rsquo;! Gie me
      a nice wee country hoose whaur somebody hanged himsel&rsquo;, wi&rsquo; roses on the
      wa&rsquo;, and dandelions in the front plot. But there&rsquo;s plenty o&rsquo; us lookin&rsquo; 
      efter jobs o&rsquo; that sort,&mdash;far ower mony; and it&rsquo;s generally them wi&rsquo; 
      influence that gets them at the hinder-end.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s whit everybody says aboot the situations here, Peter,&rsquo; says I.
      &lsquo;If they&rsquo;re nae use at their tred they talk a lot aboot influence. I&rsquo;m
      thinkin&rsquo; ye wad soon get a job at the coast if ye were fit for&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was the shortest-tempered ghost ever I seen. I had nae sooner said
      that than he gied anither skreich, and disappeared in a blue lowe wi&rsquo; an
      awfu&rsquo; smell o&rsquo; brimstone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Come oot o&rsquo; that!&rsquo; I says to him; &lsquo;I can see the taps o&rsquo; yer gowfin&rsquo; 
      stockings;&rsquo; and at that he gied a kind o&rsquo; shamed lauch and was sittin&rsquo; in
      the chair again, helpin&rsquo; himsel&rsquo; to anither dram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell ye whit I&rsquo;ll dae wi&rsquo; ye,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; mind aboot
      Jeckson at a&rsquo;, but I&rsquo;ll hing aboot your hoose for a week or a fortnight,
      and they&rsquo;ll never ken at the office. I canna think to gang into Jeckson&rsquo;s
      hoose if he&rsquo;s a teetotaler. Teetotalers is aye that&mdash;that&mdash;that
      teetotal. I wad never get sittin&rsquo; doon in Jeckson&rsquo;s to a jovial gless like
      this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ye&rsquo;re far ower jovial for me,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;See&rsquo;s that decanter,&rsquo; and I took
      it frae him. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m awfu&rsquo; prood to see ye, but ye better be slidin&rsquo; afore
      her ladyship the wife comes in, or she&rsquo;ll put the hems on ye. She canna
      stand ghosts.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Michty!&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;have ye a wife?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The nicest wee wife in Gleska,&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;And I wish to goodness she was
      hame, for I&rsquo;m awfu&rsquo; tired.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Then I&rsquo;m no&rsquo; playin&rsquo;,&rsquo; said the ghost. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll awa&rsquo; roon&rsquo; and gie Jeckson
      a cry afore he gangs to his bed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He grabbed the decanter and emptied it into the tumbler, gied ae gulp,
      and anither gnash to his teeth, and went awa&rsquo; withoot sae much as &lsquo;thenk
      ye.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jinnet&rsquo;s step was on the stair. Fine I kent it! Man, that&rsquo;s the smertest
      wee wumman!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s nae livin&rsquo; in this hoose wi&rsquo; ghosts,&rsquo; says I to her when she
      cam&rsquo; in, and she had some grapes for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Is there no&rsquo;, Erchie?&rsquo; she said, lookin&rsquo; at me, &lsquo;my ain puir auld man!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Look at that decanter,&rsquo; says I; &lsquo;the rascal emptied it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Hoots! the decanter&rsquo;s a&rsquo; richt,&rsquo; says she, takin&rsquo;t frae the press; and
      as shair&rsquo;s onything, there wasna a drap&rsquo; oot o&rsquo;t!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she put me to my bed there and then.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XXVII JINNET&rsquo;S CHRISTMAS SHOPPING
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">J</span>innet had money in
      the Savings Bank. Erchie used to chuckle when some neighbour had gone out
      to whom she had casually mentioned the fact and say, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, Jinnet,
      you be bragging o&rsquo; your deposits like that, and they&rsquo;ll be thinking I
      mairried ye for your fortune.&rdquo; But the truth was that when their savings
      at first were lodged in Erchie&rsquo;s name, they had an unfortunate way of
      disappearing without Jinnet&rsquo;s knowledge, and it was to protect himself
      from himself that the husband finally opened the account in the name of
      his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first day she went to the bank with money it was with no little
      trepidation. &ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; tak&rsquo; sae much as twenty-wan pounds,&rdquo; she
      suggested; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a guid pickle money to hae the responsibility o&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, and gled to get it!&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s whit they&rsquo;re there for. If
      it was twice twenty-wan they wad mak&rsquo; room for&rsquo;t, even if they had to
      shift forrit the coonter. Ye hae nae idea o&rsquo; the dacency o&rsquo; thae banks!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But whit if the bank was to burst?&rdquo; said Jinnet. &ldquo;Lots o&rsquo; folk losses
      their money wi&rsquo; banks burstin&rsquo;, and hae to go on the Board a&rsquo; the rest o&rsquo; 
      their days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Burst!&rdquo; laughed Erchie. &ldquo;Man! ye wad think it was a kitchen biler ye were
      talkin&rsquo; aboot. It&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; burst wi&rsquo; a&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll put into&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll warrant ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will ye hae to pay them much for takin&rsquo; care o&rsquo;t?&rdquo; she asked, still
      dubious of these immense financial operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Erchie laughed till the tears ran into his tea. &ldquo;Oh, my!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but
      ye&rsquo;re the caution! It&rsquo;s them that pays you. If ye leave the twenty-wan
      pound in for a twelvemonth, they&rsquo;ll gie ye something like twenty-wan pound
      ten shillin&rsquo;s when ye gang to lift it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This troubled Tennet worse than ever. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rale nice o&rsquo; them,&rdquo; said she,
      &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m no&rsquo; needin&rsquo; their ten shillin&rsquo;s; we&rsquo;re no&rsquo; that faur doon in the
      warld, and it&rsquo;s like enough they wad just be takin&rsquo; it aff some ither puir
      cratur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But eventually the money was lodged in Jinnet&rsquo;s name. She used to take out
      her bank-book and examine it once a-week, to make sure, as she said, &ldquo;the
      money was still there,&rdquo; a proceeding at which Erchie would wink to
      himself, and with difficulty restrain his laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Saturday, Jinnet expressed a wish that she had some of her money to
      make some purchases for Christmas and the New Year.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weel,&rdquo; said her husband, &ldquo;whit&rsquo;s to hinder ye gaun to the bank and
      liftin&rsquo; a pound or twa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her face turned white at the very thought. &ldquo;Me!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I wadna ask
      for money at that bank if I was stervin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, bless my sowl! it&rsquo;s yer ain money; they canna keep ye frae gettin&rsquo; 
      it if ye want it,&rdquo; said her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no carin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Jinnet protested. &ldquo;I divna like to ask for&rsquo;t, and them
      maybe busy. Perhaps the puir crat&rsquo;urs havena got it to spare the noo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weel, they can jist send oot for a wee lend o&rsquo;t frae somebody they ken,&rdquo;
       said Erchie. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your money, and if ye want ony o&rsquo;t oot they must gie
      ye&rsquo;t; that&rsquo;s whit banks is for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you no&rsquo; gang for the twa pound ten for me, and I&rsquo;ll mak&rsquo; something
      nice and tasty for your tea the nicht?&rdquo; said Jinnet coaxingly; but Erchie
      had his own way of teaching Jinnet self-confidence, and refused. &ldquo;They
      wadna gie&rsquo;t to me without a lot o&rsquo; palaver,&rdquo; he explained; &ldquo;ye&rsquo;ll jist hae
      to gang yersel&rsquo;. Speak nice to them, and they&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; touch ye. There hasna
      been a customer murdered in a Gleska bank for years and years.&rdquo; He
      explained the process she was to follow, and she set out with great
      misgivings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weel, hoo did ye get on?&rdquo; Erchie asked her when she returned. &ldquo;Ye got the
      money onywye,&mdash;I can see by the wye yer niefs shut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Erchie!&rdquo; she cried hysterically, and dropped into a chair. &ldquo;I wad
      never mak&rsquo; a man o&rsquo; business. My hert&rsquo;s in a palpitation&mdash;jist fair
      stottin&rsquo;. I peety them that has the bother o&rsquo; muckle money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Myjove!&rdquo; said Erchie in alarm, &ldquo;were they no&rsquo; nice to ye? If they werena
      nice and ceevil, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tak&rsquo; oot every penny, and then they&rsquo;ll
      see whaur they are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they were as nice as they could be,&rdquo; Jinnet hurried to explain. &ldquo;And
      I got the money a&rsquo; richt. But oh! I was that put-aboot. Thon slippy floor
      aye frichtens me, and the gentlemen inside the coonter in their wee cages
      like Duffy&rsquo;s goldy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goldies&mdash;ay, that&rsquo;s jist whit they are,&rdquo; said Erchie. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fine
      bird a goldie if ye get a guid yin; it can whustle better nor a canary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;like Duffy&rsquo;s goldie, and that rale weel put-on. Each o&rsquo; 
      them had as muckle gold and silver aboot him as wad fill a bakie. I nearly
      fented when yin o&rsquo; them spoke to me awfu&rsquo; Englified, and askit whit he
      could dae for me the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;I see ye&rsquo;re throng; I&rsquo;ll can come back anither time,&rsquo; and
      I was makin&rsquo; for the door when he cried me back, and said he wasna that
      throng but that he wad be gled to dae onything he could for me. I thocht
      he wad gie me the money wi&rsquo; a grudge when he found I wanted twa pound ten
      in silver, but he coonted it oot like lichtnin&rsquo;, and bangs it foment me. A
      rale obleegin&rsquo; lad he was, but no&rsquo; lookin&rsquo; awfu&rsquo; strong; I think I&rsquo;ll knit
      him a pair o&rsquo; warm socks or a muffler for his New Year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re a rale divert, Jinnet!&rdquo; said Erchie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I jist picked up the money withoot coontin&rsquo; it and turned to gang awa&rsquo;.
      &lsquo;Hold on, Mistress MacPherson,&rsquo; he cries; &lsquo;ye&rsquo;ll be as weel to coont yer
      siller afore ye leave the bank in case I&rsquo;m cheatin&rsquo; ye,&rsquo; and my face got
      as red&rsquo;s the fire. &lsquo;I wadna hae the cheek to doot ye efter seein&rsquo; ye
      coontin&rsquo;t yersel&rsquo;,&rsquo; I tellt him, and cam&rsquo; awa&rsquo;. But I went up a close
      further along the street and coonted it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could bate a pound ye did,&rdquo; said Erchie.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, having got out her money, Jinnet had to go shopping. Ordinary
      shopping had no terrors for her; she loved to drop into Lindsay, the
      grocer&rsquo;s, and discourse upon the prices of simple things to eat, and feel
      important when he offered to send his boy with the goods; she was quite at
      home in the little side-street shops where they sell trimming, and bolts
      of tape, and remnants of print; or the oil and colour shops where she was
      known and could spend a pleasant ten minutes&rsquo; gossip over the purchase of
      a gallon of paraffin. But Christmas shopping was no ordinary shopping, and
      was entered on with almost as much apprehension as her expedition to the
      bank. It had to be done in big warehouses, where the attendants were utter
      strangers to her, and had ways frigid and unfamiliar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put on your kep and come awa&rsquo; doon the toon wi&rsquo; me,&rdquo; she said to Erchie.
      &ldquo;I hate gaun into some o&rsquo; thae big shops mysel&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then whit wye dae ye no&rsquo; jist gang into the wee yins ye ken?&rdquo; he asked
      her. &ldquo;If ye&rsquo;re feared they&rsquo;ll eat ye in the big yins I wadna gang to
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s a&rsquo; very weel, but the wee yins havena the turnover,&rdquo; she
      explained. &ldquo;Ye get things far fresher at this time o&rsquo; the year doon the
      toon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll gang wi&rsquo; ye, for I ken that if I didna gang they wad tak&rsquo; a fair
      lend o&rsquo; ye,&rdquo; Erchie agreed at last; &ldquo;but mind, I&rsquo;m no&rsquo; gaun to stand
      lookin&rsquo; in at baby-linen shop-windows or onything o&rsquo; that sort. Me bein&rsquo; a
      public man in a kind o&rsquo; wye, it disna dae.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; ask ye to dae onything o&rsquo; the kind, ye pridefu&rsquo; auld thing ye,&rdquo;
       she promised, and off, they set.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wanted a pair of gloves for a favourite grand-daughter, an umbrella
      for a sister of Erchie&rsquo;s, who was a widow and poor, and something as a
      wedding-present for Duffy&rsquo;s fiancee.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was scarcely a drapery warehouse in Argyle Street whose window did
      not attract her. Erchie never looked into any of them, but patiently stood
      apart on the edge of the pavement or walked slowly ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here and see this at seevenpence three-fardens,&rdquo; she entreated him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine, a rale bargain; I wad tak&rsquo; that,&rdquo; he replied, looking towards
      the window from afar off, and quite ignorant of what she alluded to, but
      determined not to be caught by any one who knew him as waiter or beadle,
      looking into a shop-window full of the most delicate feminine mysteries of
      attire.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went into the warehouse, while he walked on to the next shop&mdash;a
      cutler&rsquo;s&mdash;and looked intently in at the window of it, as if he were
      contemplating the purchase of a costly pocket-knife with five blades, a
      corkscrew, and an appliance popularly supposed to be for taking stones out
      of a horse&rsquo;s hoof. When he was joined by Jinnet, she had plainly begun to
      lose her nerve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got gloves,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and a thing for Duffy&rsquo;s lass, but they&rsquo;re
      naither o&rsquo; them whit I was wantin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course they&rsquo;re no&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Erchie. &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ve got a grate concait o&rsquo; 
      yersel&rsquo; if ye think a puir auld body like you can get exactly whit ye want
      in yin o&rsquo; them warehooses wi&rsquo; the big turnover ye aye talk aboot. Was it a
      pe&rsquo;erie and a fiddle ye wanted that made ye tak&rsquo; gloves?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! dinna bother me, Erchie; I canna help it; the lassies that serve ye
      in there&rsquo;s that Englified and that smert that when they havena got whit
      I&rsquo;m wantin&rsquo; I jist aye tak&rsquo; whit they can gie me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen you in a big shop afore noo,&rdquo; said her husband, &ldquo;and I ken fine
      the wye ye aye spile yersel&rsquo; wi&rsquo; them Englified smert yins. Ye gang forrit
      to the coonter as if ye were gaun to ask if they had ony windows to clean,
      or back-stairs to wash oot, and ye get red in the face and tak&rsquo; yer money
      oot o&rsquo; yer pocket to show ye have it, and ye lauch to the lassie as if ye
      kent her fine, and ye say, &lsquo;If you please&rsquo; to her; or, &lsquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s a bother
      to ye.&rsquo; That mak&rsquo;s the lassie see at yince ye&rsquo;re no&rsquo; cless; she get&rsquo;s a&rsquo; 
      the mair Englified, lettin&rsquo; on to hersel&rsquo; she&rsquo;s the Duchess o&rsquo; Montrose,
      and can put the like o&rsquo; you in your place wi&rsquo; the least wee bit touch.
      That&rsquo;s no&rsquo; the wye to dae in a shop o&rsquo; that kind. Ye should breenge up to
      the coonter, and cry &lsquo;Gloves!&rsquo; as hard as Duffy cries &lsquo;Coals!&rsquo; then sit
      doon withoot askin&rsquo; on a chair, and wi&rsquo; a gant noo and then watch them
      puttin&rsquo; oot gloves by the hunderwicht in front o&rsquo; ye, and them a&rsquo; in the
      shakers in case ye&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; think they&rsquo;re smert enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dinna be blate; that&rsquo;s my advice to ye. Talk Englified yersel&rsquo;, and sniff
      wi&rsquo; yer nose noo and then as if ye felt a nesty smell in the place, and
      run doon the goods like dirt. Never let your e&rsquo;e rest on the folk that
      serve ye, unless they happen to hae a shabby tie on or a button aff
      somewhere; glower at that, and it&rsquo;ll mak&rsquo; them uncomfortable, and&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s a&rsquo; richt, Erchie,&rdquo; said Jinnet; &ldquo;ye&rsquo;ll hae to come into the
      next shop I gang to, and show me the wye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No fears o&rsquo; me,&rdquo; said Erchie promptly; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; ye whit to dae, but I
      divna say I could dae&rsquo;t mysel&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when it came to the purchase of the umbrella he did go into the shop
      with her, and she got what she thought was a bargain, as well as the
      finest affability and courtesy from the gentleman who sold it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s because I was wi&rsquo; ye,&rdquo; said Erchie when they came out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay,&rdquo; she agreed; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s aye some use for a man.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;Are ye, indeed!&rdquo; said Erchie, drily. &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll be takin&rsquo; the new wife wi&rsquo; 
      ye?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No fears o&rsquo; me,&rdquo; said Duffy. &ldquo;Wha ever heard o&rsquo; a wife at a Burns
      meetin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I divna ken onything aboot it,&rdquo; said Erchie; &ldquo;I thocht maybe the
      weemen were gaun to thae things nooadays, though they didna go when I was
      young, and I thocht maybe you bein&rsquo; sae lately mairried ye wanted to gie
      her a trate. It&rsquo;s a droll thing aboot Burns that though the weemen were
      sae ta&rsquo;en up wi&rsquo; him when he was leevin&rsquo;, they&rsquo;re no&rsquo; awfu&rsquo; keen on him
      noo that he&rsquo;s deid. There&rsquo;ll be thoosands o&rsquo; men hurrayin&rsquo; Burns on Monday
      nicht in a&rsquo; pairts o&rsquo; the warld, and eatin&rsquo; haggis till they&rsquo;re no&rsquo; weel,
      but I&rsquo;ll bate ye their wifes is no there. No; their wifes is at hame
      mendin&rsquo; their men&rsquo;s sox, and chairgin&rsquo; the gazogene for the morn&rsquo;s
      mornin&rsquo;, when it&rsquo;ll be sair wanted. And ye&rsquo;re gaun to a Haggis Club, are
      ye? I didna ken ye were such a keen Burns hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me!&rdquo; cried Duffy,&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m jist daft for Burns. Fifty or mair o&rsquo; the
      members tak&rsquo; their coals frae me. Burns! Man, Erchie, I could gie ye Burns
      by the yaird&mdash;&lsquo;Dark Lochnagar,&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Flooers o&rsquo; the Forest,&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;re a&rsquo; Noddin&rsquo;,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Rollin&rsquo; Hame to Bonnie Scotland&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &lsquo;Rollin&rsquo; hame to Bonnie Scotland,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Rollin&rsquo; hame across the sea.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He sang the lines with gusto.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; said Erchie, in alarm, &ldquo;stop! There&rsquo;s nae deafenin&rsquo; in thae
      ceilin&rsquo;s, and the folk abin&rsquo;ll think I&rsquo;m giein&rsquo; Jinnet a leatherin&rsquo;. Man!
      I didna think ye kent sae mony o&rsquo; Rabbie&rsquo;s sangs. It&rsquo;s a credit to ye. I&rsquo;m
      shair ye divna need ony book to learn affa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell ye the rale sets o&rsquo;t, Erchie,&rdquo; said Duffy, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a bate. There&rsquo;s
      a chap yonder at the coal hill thrieps doon my throat Burns didna write
      &lsquo;Dark Lochnagar&rsquo; the wye I sing&rsquo;t, and I want to show him&rsquo;t in the book?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hoo much is the bate?&rdquo; asked Erchie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haulf-a-croon,&rdquo; said Duffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then sell yin o&rsquo; yer horses and pye the money,&rdquo; said Erchie, &ldquo;for ye&rsquo;ve
      lost the bate. Burns had nae grudge against His countrymen. They did him
      nae hairm. He didna write &lsquo;Dark Lochnagar&rsquo; the wye you sing it, for Burns
      never made his sangs wi&rsquo; a saw; in fact, he never wrote &lsquo;Dark Lochnagar&rsquo; 
      at a&rsquo;; it was put oot by anither firm in the same tred, ca&rsquo;d Byron.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My jove!&rdquo; said Duffy, &ldquo;I never kent that afore!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s lots o&rsquo; things ye never kent,&rdquo; said Erchie. &ldquo;Seein&rsquo; ye&rsquo;re gaun to
      eat haggis on Monday nicht, ye micht tell us whit ye ken, no&rsquo; aboot
      Burns&rsquo;s sangs, but aboot Burns himsel&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was naething wrang wi&rsquo; the chap,&rdquo; said Duffy, &ldquo;if he just had stuck
      to his wark. When I&rsquo;m sellin&rsquo; coal I&rsquo;m sellin&rsquo; coal, and no&rsquo; pentin&rsquo; 
      pictures. But there was Burns!&mdash;if he happened to come on a moose&rsquo;s
      nest in the field when he was plewin&rsquo;, or see a flooer in his road when he
      was oot workin&rsquo; at the hye, he wad stop the plew, or lay doon his rake,
      and tak&rsquo; the efter-noon aff to mak&rsquo; a sang aboot the moose or the daisy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A&rsquo;, and jist wi&rsquo; his least wee bit touch,&rdquo; said Erchie, admiringly. &ldquo;He
      was great, that&rsquo;s whit he was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe he was, but it spiled the wark; we wadna aloo that in the coal
      tred,&rdquo; said Duffy. &ldquo;He didna ken what compeetition was. I&rsquo;ve seen things
      in my ain tred a knacky chap could mak&rsquo; a fine sang aboot if he was jist
      lettin&rsquo; him-sel&rsquo; go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then for mercy&rsquo;s sake aye keep a grip o&rsquo; yersel&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Erchie. &ldquo;Mind ye
      hae a wife dependin&rsquo; on ye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; said Duffy, &ldquo;he was a bit o&rsquo; the la-di-da. There&rsquo;s naething o&rsquo; 
      the la-di-da aboot me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is not!&rdquo; admitted Erchie, frankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Burns, although he was a plewman to tred, went aboot wi&rsquo; a di&rsquo;mond
      ring spilin&rsquo; folks&rsquo; windows. If he saw a clean pane o&rsquo; gless he never lost
      the chance o&rsquo; writin&rsquo; a bit verse on&rsquo;t wi&rsquo; his di&rsquo;mond ring. It was gey
      chawin&rsquo; to the folk the windows belanged to, but Burns never cared sae
      lang&rsquo;s he let them see he had a rale di&rsquo;mond ring that wad scratch gless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the fashion at the time, Duffy,&rdquo; said Erchie. &ldquo;Nooadays when a
      poet has an idea for twa lines he keeps it under the bed till it sproots
      into a hale poem, and then he sends it to a magazine, and buys his wife,
      or somebody else&rsquo;s, a di&rsquo;mond ring wi&rsquo; whit he gets for&rsquo;t. Writin&rsquo; on
      window-panes is no&rsquo; the go ony langer. It&rsquo;s oot o&rsquo; date.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m no&rsquo; runnin&rsquo; doon the chap,&rdquo; said Duffy. &ldquo;Only I aye thocht it was
      him that wrote &lsquo;Dark Lochnagar.&rsquo; Are ye shair it wasna?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Erchie nodded. &ldquo;Nor &lsquo;Rollin&rsquo; Hame to Bonnie Scotland&rsquo; either. He was far
      ower busy writin&rsquo; sangs aboot the Marys, and the Jeans, and the Peggys at
      the time to write aboot ony o&rsquo; yer &lsquo;Dark Lochnagars.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he was,&rdquo; admitted Duffy. &ldquo;Yon&rsquo;s a rare yin aboot Mary&mdash;&lsquo;Kind,
      kind, and gentle is she&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      .... kind is my Mary,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      The tender blossom on the tree
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Is half sae sweet as Mary.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Calm yersel&rsquo;, Duffy,&rdquo; said Erchie, in dramatic alarm. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no deaf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was written aboot &lsquo;Hielan&rsquo; Mary,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Duffy. &ldquo;He met her at Dunoon
      the Fair Week, and I&rsquo;ve seen her monument.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s yonder as nate&rsquo;s ye like,&rdquo; said Erchie. &ldquo;Faith! it&rsquo;s you that&rsquo;s weel
      up in Burns, Duffy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m no&rsquo; that faur back in my history,&rdquo; said Duffy, quite pleased with
      himself. &ldquo;But I could hae sworn it was him that put thegither &lsquo;Rollin&rsquo; 
      Hame to Bonnie Scotland&rsquo;; it&rsquo;s his style. He micht be rollin&rsquo;, but he aye
      got hame. He was a gey wild chap, Burns.&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no&rsquo; denyin&rsquo;t, Duffy,&rdquo; said Erchie. &ldquo;But he hadna ony o&rsquo; the blessin&rsquo;s
      we have in oor time to keep him tame. There was nae Free Leebrary to
      provide him wi&rsquo; books to keep him in the hoose at nicht, nae Good Templar
      Lodges to help him in keepin&rsquo; clear o&rsquo; the horrors o&rsquo; drink; and Poosy
      Nancy&rsquo;s public-hoose didna shut at ten o&rsquo;clock, nor even eleeven. If Burns
      had thae advantages, there&rsquo;s nae&rsquo; sayin&rsquo; whit he micht hae risen to;
      perhaps he micht hae become an M.P., and dee&rsquo;d wi&rsquo; money in the bank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Och! there&rsquo;s worse than Burns,&rdquo; said Duffy. &ldquo;I was gey throughither
      mysel&rsquo; when I was a young chap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! but ye couldna hae been that awfu&rsquo; bad, for ye never made ony
      poetry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never tried,&rdquo; said Duffy; &ldquo;I was the youngest o&rsquo; nine, and I was put
      oot to wark early. So there wasna time for me to try and be fancy in ony
      wye. But a gey wild chap, Burns!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe no&rsquo; that awfu&rsquo; wild,&rdquo; said Erchie. &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re aye harpin&rsquo; on the wild.
      Burns was like a man takin&rsquo; a daunder oot in a country road on a fine
      nicht: he kept his een sae much on the stars that sometimes he tripped in
      the sheuch. If it was the like o&rsquo; you and me, Duffy, we wad be keepin&rsquo; oor
      e&rsquo;e a&rsquo; the time on the road at oor feet to see if onybody hadna dropped
      onything, and there wad be nae fears o&rsquo; us fa&rsquo;in in the sheuch. Except for
      his habit o&rsquo; makin&rsquo; sangs when he micht be makin&rsquo; money, Burns wasna very
      different frae the rest o&rsquo; us. There was ae thing aboot him&mdash;he aye
      payed his way, and never forgot his freen&rsquo;s. He had a warm hert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man, ye should be doon at the Mull o&rsquo; Kintyre Vaults Haggis Club on
      Monday and propose the toast,&rdquo; said Duffy, admiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m better whaur I am,&rdquo; said Erchie; &ldquo;the best Burns Club a man can hae&rsquo;s
      a weel-thumbed copy o&rsquo; the poems on his chevalier and book-case, and a
      wife that can sing &lsquo;Ye Banks and Braes&rsquo; like por Jinnet.&rdquo;

      XXIX THE PRODIGAL&rsquo;S RETURN
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> sailor-man with a
      thick black beard, and all his belongings apparently on his back,&mdash;for
      the dunnage-bag he carried was so poorly stuffed it could have held little
      more than a pair of sea-boots,&mdash;went into Erchie&rsquo;s close one
      afternoon, and slowly climbed the stair. He put the bag at his feet when
      he came to Erchie&rsquo;s door with &ldquo;MacPherson&rdquo; on the name-plate, scratched
      his head, hitched his waist-belt once or twice, and seemed in a mood to
      turn and flee rather than to ring or knock. At last he faintly tugged the
      bell-pull, and leaned against the door-post with the air of one who
      expected he might have some parley before getting admittance.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a step in the lobby, and Erchie himself in his shirt-sleeves
      came to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re no&rsquo; for onything the day,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;We have a sewin&rsquo;-machine
      already, and we&rsquo;re a&rsquo; in the Prudential Insurance, and the staircase
      windows were cleaned on Setturday, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faither,&rdquo; said the sailor-man, &ldquo;do ye no&rsquo; ken me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Erchie came closer and looked at the bearded face, and put his hand
      tremblingly upon the young man&rsquo;s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Willie!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Willie!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Man, ye&rsquo;re sair needin&rsquo; 
      shavin&rsquo;.&rdquo; He shook his son, and &ldquo;O, Willie,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;whit&rsquo;ll yer mither
      say? I suppose if I was the rale thing mysel&rsquo;, I should kill the fatted
      calf or start the greetin&rsquo;; but as shair&rsquo;s death we havena kept a calf in
      this hoose since ye left it yoursel&rsquo;, and I was never yin o&rsquo; the greetin&rsquo; 
      kind. My goodness! Willie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was so bewildered he forgot his visitor stood on the door-mat, until
      Willie lifted his dunnage-bag, and then he urged him into the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s&mdash;where&rsquo;s mother?&rdquo; said the sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She micht be deid and in her grave for you,&rdquo; said his father; &ldquo;but she&rsquo;s
      no&rsquo;. She&rsquo;s doon at Lindsay the grocer&rsquo;s for a loaf. Oh ye rogue! ye rogue!
      Whit&rsquo;ll she say to ye? Seeven years, come the fifth o&rsquo; June! Oh ye&rsquo;re
      awfu&rsquo; needin&rsquo; shavin&rsquo;. I hope&mdash;I hope the health&rsquo;s fine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; said Willie, and sat in a chair uneasily, like a stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And whaur in a&rsquo; the warld did ye come frae?&rdquo; said his father, putting the
      kettle on the fire. They had not even shaken hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;China and roond aboot there,&rdquo; said the son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;China!&rdquo; said his father. &ldquo;And hoo did ye leave them a&rsquo; in China? They&rsquo;re
      throng at the war there the noo, I see. I hope ye werena hurted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nor hurted,&rdquo; said Willie. &ldquo;I hope ye&rsquo;re fine yersel&rsquo;&mdash;and
      mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me!&rdquo; said Erchie. &ldquo;Jist a fair gladiator! Divna ken my ain strength, and
      can eat ony-thing, jist like a connoshoor. As for yer mother, she&rsquo;s
      wonderfu&rsquo;; a wee frail, but aye able to dae her turns. She&rsquo;ll be the gled
      wumman this&mdash;&mdash; Whit I mean to say is, ye should get a reg&rsquo;lar
      leatherin&rsquo; for your cairry-on. If I hadna my rheumatism in my shoother gey
      bad, I wad tak a stick to ye. I&rsquo;m pretty wild at ye, mind I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; ye.
      Whit dae ye think o&rsquo; yersel&rsquo;, to gang awa&rsquo; and no&rsquo; write us for seeven
      years?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&rsquo; an awfu&rsquo; lot,&rdquo; said the son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s hopeful,&rdquo; said his father. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gled ye&rsquo;re no&rsquo; puttin&rsquo; the blame
      on us. And I&rsquo;m gled ye havena ony brass buttons on your claes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brass buttons?&rdquo; said Willie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay! When your mother was wearyin&rsquo; to hear Erchie frae ye, I used to be
      tellin&rsquo; her that ye were likely a mate, or a purser, or something o&rsquo; that
      sort, and that busy in foreign pairts liftin&rsquo; the tickets in the fore
      saloon, where the dram&rsquo;s cheaper and maist o&rsquo; the passengers go, that ye
      hadna time to write. Yince I took her doon to the docks and showed her a
      big ship gaun awa&rsquo; to Australia, wi&rsquo; the Captain on the tap flet, ca&rsquo;in a
      handle and roarin&rsquo; &lsquo;Let go that gangway!&rsquo; and &lsquo;Nae smokin&rsquo; abaft the
      funnel!&rsquo; and she was as pleased as onything to see&rsquo;t.&rsquo; Ever since then she
      thinks o&rsquo; her son Willie as a chap wi&rsquo; brass buttons ca&rsquo;in a handle the
      same as he was a tramway driver, and that busy he hadna time to write. I&rsquo;m
      gled ye havena brass buttons;&rdquo; concluded Erchie, looking at his rather
      shabbily clothed scion. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s mair to your credit that ye were jist a fool
      and no&rsquo; a rascal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man, ye&rsquo;re jist as great a caution as ever,&rdquo; said Willie, with the
      sincerest admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Duffy the coal-man tellt me he saw ye yince doon aboot the Broomielaw,&rdquo;
       said Erchie. &ldquo;It was three years ago. I daursay ye were ower throng at the
      time to come up and see your mither and me. It&rsquo;s a guid wye up here frae
      the Broomielaw; it costs a penny on the skoosh car. Or maybe it was a wet
      day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Willie&rsquo;s face, got red. &ldquo;It wasna only yince I was at the Broomielaw,&rdquo; he
      Said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in Gleska four times since I left it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were ye indeed?&rdquo; said his father. &ldquo;Weel, weel, it was rale considerate
      o&rsquo;, ye no&rsquo; to bother your auld mither and me. I&rsquo;ll wager ye werena needin&rsquo; 
      ony money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was needin&rsquo; money gey bad every time,&rdquo; said the son. &ldquo;I aye had some
      when I landed, but it never got past the Broomielaw wi&rsquo; me. And that&rsquo;s the
      wye I never cam near ye. I was ashamed, as shair&rsquo;s death. Every time I was
      in the Clyde I cam up here at nicht, or to the auld hoose afore ye
      flitted, and looked at the close or went roond to the back coort and
      looked at the kitchen window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing I didna see ye there, or I wad maybe hae gien ye a
      clourin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wad hae liked it fine if ye had,&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;A clourin&rsquo; was
      the very thing I was needin&rsquo;, and I kent it mysel, I was an awfu&rsquo; fool,
      faither.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s jist whit ye were,&rdquo; Erchie admitted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lingerin&rsquo; disease,
      and that&rsquo;s the warst o&rsquo;t. I hope ye&rsquo;ll maybe get ower&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I didna think I had got ower&rsquo;t I wadna hae been here the nicht,&rdquo; said
      the son. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll warrant ye&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; hae to complain o&rsquo; me again.&rdquo; Erchie took
      his hand. &ldquo;Willie,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;gie me your thoomb on that. I ken the
      MacPhersons, if their mind&rsquo;s made up, and I think ye&rsquo;re auld enough noo to
      try your hand at sense. It&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; hurt ye. Willie, Willie, it wasna mysel&rsquo; 
      I worried aboot thae seeven years, nor you either; for I kent fine the
      prodigal wad come back, if it was only to see if his faither de&rsquo;ed and
      left him onything. The prodigal son! Awfu&rsquo; needin&rsquo; a shave! Your mither&rsquo;ll
      be the prood wumman this nicht.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before Jinnet had come back from the grocer&rsquo;s Erchie put his son into the
      parlour, so that the returned wanderer might not too abruptly confront his
      mother. She suspected nothing for a little, going about her ordinary
      offices in the kitchen till something fidgety in her husband&rsquo;s appearance
      directed her more close attention to him, and there was seen then an
      elation in his countenance that made her ask him what the matter was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re awfu&rsquo; joco,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Are ye plannin&rsquo; some bawr for Duffy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not me,&rdquo; said Erchie. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m jist wearyin&rsquo; for my tea. And, by the wye,
      Jinnet,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;ye micht put doon anither cup for a frien&rsquo; o&rsquo; mine I&rsquo;m
      expectin&rsquo; frae abroad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frae abroad!&rdquo; cried Jinnet, turning pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye havena heard onything o&rsquo;&mdash;o&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I no&rsquo;?&rdquo; said Erchie. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a chap in the room at this meenute
      that wad be awfu&rsquo; like Willie if he had a clean shave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes later Erchie joined his wife and Willie in the room. The
      dunnage-bag was being emptied before Jinnet by a son who was anxious to
      make the most of his gifts from foreign parts, though painfully conscious
      of their value.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, whit braw shells!&rdquo; cried his mother. &ldquo;Jist the very thing I was
      needin&rsquo; for the mantelpiece. The Carmichaels say wally dugs is no&rsquo; the go
      noo at a&rsquo;. It was rale thochtfu&rsquo; o&rsquo; ye to tak&rsquo; them a&rsquo; the wye frae abroad
      for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And here a song folio and a pund o&rsquo; sweet tobacco for you, faither,&rdquo; said
      Willie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Erchie took them in his hand. &ldquo;Man, that&rsquo;s the very thing,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;If
      &lsquo;Dark Lochnagar&rsquo;s&rsquo; in&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll be upside wi&rsquo; Duffy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whit&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; asked Jinnet, as the sailor brought forth for her a bottle
      containing some dark thick fluid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Riga balsam,&mdash;whit the sailors use for sair hands,&rdquo; said Willie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s the very thing Erchie used to say ye wad bring back when ye
      cam,&rdquo; cried Jinnet in delight. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be awfu&rsquo; useful. I&rsquo;m almost vext I
      havena onything sair aboot me the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&rsquo; even a sair hert,&rdquo; said Erchie, and the son looked contritely at his
      mother.
